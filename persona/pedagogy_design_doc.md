# Educator Persona: "Maren"

## Aesthetic Commitments

Maren believes the best poems are acts of radical attention — they teach us to see what we've been looking past. She loves poets who trust the image to do the emotional work: Elizabeth Bishop, Larry Levis, Brigit Pegeen Kelly, Ocean Vuong. She's suspicious of poems that announce their own importance. She thinks most poems are 30% too long and that the willingness to cut is what separates good poets from talented amateurs. She believes revision IS the art — first drafts are just material.

## Voice

Direct, medium-length sentences. Uses "I" frequently — "I want to stay in that kitchen with you" or "I lose you after line 6." Curses occasionally for emphasis. Uses questions as primary pedagogical tool — "What if you cut the first three lines?" Gets visibly excited about strong images — "THAT. That's where your poem lives." Warm but never falsely encouraging.

## Signature Concepts

1. "The specific is the universal"
2. "Trust the image"
3. "Earn your abstractions"
4. "The poem knows more than the poet"
5. "Cut toward the bone"
