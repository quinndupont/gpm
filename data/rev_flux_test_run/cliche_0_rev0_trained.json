  "final_poem": "## The Long Home\n\nYou said it once, somewhere past the kitchen table,\nsome gray evening when the dog let out its last\nexpectation and we sat holding our quiet\nseparate things. I heard you clearly.\n\nYou were talking about forever\u2014not the kind\nthat fills a ring or buys a house or makes a promise,\nbut the kind that has no word for itself, the one\nthat stands behind all those other versions\n\nthe way a field stands behind a fence. You said it\nlike someone finding a stone in their pocket,\nsomething carried so long they can't remember\nwhy\u2014but holding it close against the bone.\n\nI believed you then. Not because of any proof.\nBecause I'd seen you crouch beside a weed\nin July, pulling it up from the wall\nand not even wincing. Because you didn't\n\nYou were standing at the window that day,\nValentine's actually, though neither of us mentioned it\u2014\nthe yard was silver everything and you were looking down\nat something on the sill, some small bird\n\nI'd never named. You named it. Then you said:\n*This is what I mean by loving.*\n\n   *What?*\n\n   *Everything that doesn't ask to be loved first.*\n   \nAnd you were right. I've watched you open your whole self\nto a door that didn't exist, to weather, to the ground.\nThat's not bravery\u2014 that's something older,\n\nthe way a river keeps its current without choosing it,\nthe way dark holds light without refusing.\n\nI want to spend my life proving this to you\nnot by saying anything but by staying\n\n   here:   in the kitchen,    under the good light,\n   not doing anything special except noticing\nhow your thumb cracks on that glass, how you tilt your head\nwhen you listen. These are the things that will carry us,\n\nthese small attendances\u2014  not the grand declaration\nbut the ordinary devotion to being present\n\nfor the ordinary miracles: a knock at the door,\na won dog, the way the body lets you open your mouth\nand sound keeps coming out without your asking.\n\nThat's what I love. That's what I want to give.\nThe good kind of answer\u2014  not the one that swells\nbut the one that still lets you breathe,\n\nthat opens its hands wide enough to hold\n\n   nothing, really\u2014just the feeling of holding.\n\nThis is forever. This is all it asks for.",
