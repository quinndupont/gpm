      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe opening image \u2014 the glass of water drunk from a sleeping partner's nightstand \"not out of kindness, not out of anything\" \u2014 carries genuine understatement. The admission that love here is *lack* (no declaration, no chivalry) has more force than any assertion would. The thermostat passage also works: the domestic detail doing structural work (the way a body stays warm without thinking) before the poem shifts into explanation.\n\nThe line \"I answer him. I think that's how this ends\u2014\" lands with real weight because it breaks from narration and speaks directly as an implied consciousness. That's the poem's strongest moment of presence.\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Sentimentality / editorializing (lines 17\u201320):**\n\"The space between us is made of those small denials\u2014\nnot of 'no,' but of simply not addressing\nwhat isn't worth it, what no one will miss.\"\nThis is where the poem stops trusting its own images and starts *explaining them to you*. The \"small denials\" catalog (shoes by the door, routines entwined) was already doing this work. The prose note on top of it deflates everything around it. **Direction:** Cut or radically compress this passage. Let one or two concrete gestures carry what four lines of commentary are currently destroying.\n\n**Abstraction and clich\u00e9 (lines 13\u201316):**\n\"not in language, not in any grand declaration,\nbut in the way two people keep their routines\nentwined enough no one has to warn the other\naway from accidentally crossing the line.\"\nThis is a summary of the angle given.

      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe opening glass-of-water passage is the poem's strongest moment: understated, specific, and earns its weight through action before explanation arrives. The thermostat section works \u2014 \"the house stays cool / the way a body stays warm without thinking about it\" has genuine structural insight (domestic habit as analogy for warmth) without overexplaining.\n\nThe hallway light at 6:30 is another concrete moment that does real work, watching the shadow fall across carpet without naming it. That's the poem staying in its own terms rather than commenting on itself.\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Sentimentality / editorializing (lines 17\u201320):**\n\"The space between us is made of those small denials\u2014\nnot of 'no,' but of simply not addressing\nwhat isn't worth it, what no one will miss.\"\nThis passage *is* the problem the brief warned against \u2014 a prose explanation sitting on top of already strong images. \"Small denials\" and \"entwined enough\" are vague generalizations that undo everything the poem's domestic details were building toward with precision.\n\n**Abstraction (lines 13\u201316):**\n\"Not in language, not in any grand declaration,\nbut in the way two people keep their routines\nentwined enough no one has to warn the other\naway from accidentally crossing the line.\"\nThis is a summary of what the poem should *be* showing. \"Keep their routines entwined\" and \"accidentally crossing the line\" are vague phrases that retreat into generality precisely because the domestic details were doing the work well. The dog-as-question moment nearby proves the poet can render this with specificity \u2014 the prose here is abandoning it.\n\n**Clich\u00e9 (line 21):**\n\"The way a room can be full and still\nbe quiet enough for anything.\"\nThis is sentimentally packaged silence. \"Quiet enough for the faucet in the bathroom to drip\" was already doing better work in the previous draft \u2014 that dripping was concrete, this line is abstracted into metaphor. **Direction:** Cut entirely or replace with something as specific as the hallway light doing its thing.\n\n**Redundancy (lines 17\u201320 vs. lines 9\u201312):**\nThe closing section restates what the middle has already shown. Lines 9\u201312 (\"the way a body stays warm without thinking about it\") and lines 17\u201320 say essentially the same thing with worse prose. **Direction:** The ending needs to arrive *through* image, not summary.\n\n**Weak line breaks (lines 8, 14):**\n\"without naming it\" \u2014 this is doing real work in the shadow passage but becomes weak when repeated as \"I think that's how this ends\u2014\"",

      "critique": "## Revision\n\n### Angle\nThe poem is about two people who never speak love aloud \u2014 not because they're unromantic, but because their lives are already built on habit. The domestic routine *is* the relationship: everything within reach, nothing ever crossed.\n\n### Clich\u00e9s to Avoid\n- \"I love you\" / \"your name on my lip\"\n- Red roses or any color-coded flower imagery\n- A kiss on Valentine's Day morning\n- Heartbeat/pulse metaphors (literal here \u2014 too obvious)\n- Snowfall as metaphor for love \u2014 even white has sentimentality\n- \"Forever\" as a noun, capitalized or not\n\n### Imagery Domain\nThe poem lives inside domestic routine. What does someone see when they wake up next to their partner and nothing has changed? The same chair, the same light switch, the same shadow on the floor at 6:30 AM. This is where true love lives \u2014 in what stays constant.\n\n---\n\n## Revision\n\n### Draft\n\nThere is a glass of water on the nightstand.\nAnd I have drunk from it when you were asleep\u2014\nnot out of kindness, not out of anything,\nbut because my hands knew where to go.\n\nThe thermostat has been at sixty since October.\nNeither of us checks.
