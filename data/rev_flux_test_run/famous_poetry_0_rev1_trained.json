      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### What's Alive\n\nThe opening joint-click is the strongest moment. It anchors a poem that wants to be about entropy and departure in a body, not an abstraction. \"Tendon finding its full stop again\" \u2014 that enjambment earns its break; it gives the line a physical finality before turning on what happens after.\n\n\"The air does not right things\" is a genuinely arresting opening for a poem about neglect. It's specific enough to trust and general enough to hold weight.\n\nThe passage beginning \"Your shoe prints widen / without effort, without purpose\" has real momentum \u2014 the double negative works rhythmically there because of the image around it. The idea that entropy doesn't clean but simply stops arguing with mess is genuinely interesting.\n\n\"The sound like someone clearing their throat / in a language they mostly invented\" \u2014 this is the poem's one moment of genuine strangeness, where something specific and almost comical enters the landscape without explanation. It feels earned because it arrives late enough to avoid the \"I knew what I had come for\" problem.\n\n### What Isn't Working\n\n**Abstraction bloat (lines 12\u201320).** The poem's central claim \u2014 that entropy is about abandonment, not restoration \u2014 gets lost in a thicket of abstract nouns: *silence, thing, weather, mess, reason, canopy, language*. These words insulate the reader from what should be the poem's sharpest argument. Direction: **Cut at least half of these abstractions.** Replace them with concrete physical images that enact the idea without naming it. The landscape already does this work \u2014 \"unused tracks,\" \"small animal's corridor,\" \"grade's quiet mathematical / neglect\" \u2014 trust those more.\n\n**Clich\u00e9 re-entry (lines 13, 20).** \"The particular way / a slope learns to close over the thing\" is almost the sunset-glow avoidance asked for in the brief. And \"no one is here to give them reason to\" is a soft, explanatory line that explains what the poem should be making us feel. Direction: **Every sentence should contain at least one image no other poem would use.** If you're naming emotions or giving reasons, you've drifted into essay territory.\n\n**Weak enjambment (lines 15\u201316).** \"The air does not right things. / It simply thinns above the unused tracks\" \u2014 the break here is doing nothing that a period wouldn't do. The second line doesn't intensify or turn; it just states. Direction: **Enjambment should always create tension, surprise, or double meaning at the line's edge.** If a line break can be replaced by a comma without loss of energy, rewrite the line so the break matters.\n\n**Sentimentality (final stanza).** \"No one is leaving anything\" and \"lets go of it with the same",
