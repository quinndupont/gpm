      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe opening line \u2014 \"The fog doesn't clear; it just gets thinner\" \u2014 has genuine force. It earns its compression by doing two things at once: describing weather and implying the traveler's gradual awareness. The second sentence, \"You can see / / trees are wet, their needles holding / small silver messages on the glass of every leaf,\" is the poem's strongest moment: it stays in the physical world with real attention to light passing through water-coated needles. That's perception, not decoration.\n\nThe detail of the thumb leaving dark prints on a jacket collar \u2014 that's specific, earned, and quietly strange. The rain described as stinging without being hot \u2014 another precise sensory pairing.\n\nThe final three lines (\"Your breath comes back to you / each time like it's rehearsing for the first time\" through \"nothing / to slow it down\") build a real ending: compressed, quiet, with sound doing work that explanation resists. The last line's ambiguity (is this about listening? Is the sound metaphorical?) is productive.\n\nThe short lines and tight rhythm are mostly well-managed \u2014 there's enough variation in line length to avoid monotony.\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Sentimentality / editorializing \u2014 \"Do not think about which way.\"** The parenthetical intrusion into quotation marks is the poem's single largest failure: it tells the reader what to feel and do, then immediately retreats as if embarrassed by the revelation. This undermines everything else in the draft. **Direction:** Cut this entirely. Let the fog's behavior \u2014 getting thinner where attention isn't pooling \u2014 carry the meaning without a moral overlay.\n\n**Abstraction creeping in \u2014 \"a low weight / dragging across your hip bone.\"** \"Low\" is unnecessary; \"dragging\" is doing work that \"weight\" alone could do with more trust. The image is close, but it's still telling the reader what the sensation felt like rather than rendering it. **Direction:** Replace with a concrete physical detail \u2014 something that *is* dragging or scraping.\n\n**Clich\u00e9 proximity \u2014 \"small silver messages on the glass of every leaf.\"** \"Glass\" in quotation marks around \"silver\" is doing decorative work, and \"messages\" leans toward the inspirational. The fog light here is real; don't frame it as epiphany before the poem has earned one. **Direction:** Stay with the actual surface \u2014 wet needles reflecting water vapor, if that's what's happening.\n\n**Weak line breaks \u2014 \"on the collar of your jacket where your thumb / keeps leaving prints.\"** The break on \"where\" is doing nothing; it doesn't create tension or surprise. Consider whether this line needs to be two lines at all, or whether \"keeps",
