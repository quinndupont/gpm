      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe central conceit \u2014 rain visible only through plastic, the poem seen from inside a sheltered position \u2014 is genuinely compelling and earns its complexity. The kitchen window prism passage (lines 1\u20138) does real work: it sets up the whole argument with minimal exposition. \"Light bends when it enters water\" rendered as an observed fact, not explained, is precise and alive.\n\nThe line \"and in that stripe, visible only where light / falls wrong\" has a wonderful double meaning \u2014 both misalignment of light and the reader's own occluded vision. That's the poem's best moment: specificity of observation meeting specificity of language simultaneously.\n\nThe closing image \u2014 thumbprint on glass, dark crescent on plastic bag \u2014 lands because it's concrete and earns its weight through accumulation without collapsing into summary.\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Abstraction / explanation creeping in (lines 9\u201314):**\n\"Each fingerprint dry\" \u2014 this is the poem telling us about refraction rather than showing it. \"You forget / the science simple enough for a child to name\" shifts from image into essay mode, breaking the immersion built by the window scene. Direction: cut or radically compress this passage. Let the prism image do its own explanatory work; trust the reader.\n\n**Clich\u00e9 and sentimentality (lines 21\u201324):**\n\"A bright bruise spreading over the cabinet handle\" \u2014 \"bright bruise\" is a stock phrase, and \"each drop a separate country / holding onto its own small ocean\" collapses into whimsical abstraction. These lines move away from the hard, precise language of the first half toward decoration. Direction: replace with images as specific as \"fingerprint dry.\" What does this wetness actually look like on metal? Stay material.\n\n**Redundancy (lines 25\u201330):**\nThe floor section (thinning film, not wet exactly, too clear for damp) is the poem losing its nerve. It retreats into vagueness (\"what light does when it meets a surface angled just so\") and then back to the same images of plastic and water. The repetition doesn't deepen \u2014 it dilutes. Direction: choose one image from this section and cut the rest.\n\n**Line breaks becoming decorative (throughout):**\nLines break on \"so,\" \"too,\" \"I know this\" \u2014 these are filler positions, not choices. A line break should either create tension or isolate a word with new meaning. Most of these simply pause where prose would pause. Direction: go through every break and ask whether the enjambment does something that the sentence alone doesn't.\n\n**The final stanza (lines 25\u201334)**\nbecomes a list of surfaces plus a moral conclusion (\"surfaces have always lied\"). This is the poem abandoning its image for commentary. The closing should stay in the body",
