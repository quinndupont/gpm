Wait\nthe way you wait when someone's already\nhome, which is not with urgency,\nwhich is not with anything like\nlonging. Just the feeling that\nthe house expects you.\n\nThe radiator ticks its metal legs\nagainst the baseboard every thirteen seconds.\nI know because I've counted it\nfrom your side of the bed, where you sleep\non your back with one hand under a pillow\nholding what looks like a small country,\nand the other fisted at your side\nthe way hands keep themselves when someone\nhasn't decided yet whether they're needed.\n\nThe water is almost there.\nYou don't look up until it is,\nuntil the cup fills in the time\nit takes me to exhale through the nose,\nthat particular sound we both know \u2014\nnot a sigh, not a request for more,\njust the animal need to clear the air.\n\nYou carry it down the hall barefoot,\nmug cradled like a thing of yours\nsince birth. The floorboards\nspeak their one syllable word\neach step you take and I can hear them\nthrough the door although you make no sound\nopening anything \u2014 just stand\nin the doorway, mug still full,\nthe steam already thinning.\n\nYou tip it an inch toward my face.\nI don't flinch. You pour without being asked,\nthe way you've always poured:\nnot generosity, not accident,\njust a body that has learned\nwhere another's mouth will be.",
      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### What's Alive\n\nThe domestic specificity is the engine here, and it works. The mug \"still warm from December\" \u2014 that's a real detail with emotional weight because it resists sentimentality by refusing to linger on warmth-as-connection. The water faucet scene is genuinely strong: \"the feeling that / the house expects you.\" This line earns its abstraction because every other line around it is concrete. The radiator ticking \"against the baseboard every thirteen seconds\" \u2014 the precision of the timing doesn't feel like decoration; it's observed, and that observation is what makes it credible.\n\nThe barefoot pouring in at the end is a powerful closing image: quiet, private, functional. The final line (\"not generosity, not accident, / just a body that has learned\") lands because the poem has built toward it with enough sensory material to anchor the philosophy.\n\nThe enjambment is doing real work throughout \u2014 \"you pour the milk in quiet\" breaks at \"quiet,\" isolating that word so it carries the weight of absence before the next line arrives with the pitcher sound. That's good craft.\n\n### What Isn't Working\n\n**Sentimentality / editorializing (lines 27\u201330):**\n> Just the animal need to clear the air.\n>\n> You pour without being asked,\n> the way you've always poured:\n> not generosity, not accident,\n> just a body that has learned\n> where another's mouth will be.\n\nThis is the poem explaining its own meaning. The first two lines of this passage are already in the poem; the last three restate them as commentary. Cut or rewrite entirely: \"the way you've always poured\" is doing what the closing line does better, so neither should exist. Let the pouring speak for itself.\n\n**Redundancy (lines 19\u201320):**\n> The kitchen window is the kind of dark\n> that has no name yet \u2014 before dawn\n> has any money in its pocket to pay for light.\n\n\"Dark\" appears twice in two lines, and \"no name yet\" / \"no money in its pocket\" is a personification that dilutes what could be a precise sensory claim. Either make the image sharper or cut it entirely; both clauses soften rather than sharpen.\n\n**Clich\u00e9 proximity (line 27):**\n> I can hear them\n> through the door although you make no sound\n\nThis reads almost like a greeting-card line \u2014 \"you make no sound\" is close to \"I heard you anyway.\" Make the silence do something stranger, more particular. What does the sound actually resemble? The floorboards speak one syllable each time \u2014 extend that logic.\n\n**Direction**\n\nThe revision direction: strip the three lines of explanation from near the end entirely. Trust the image of the barefoot pouring into the face. If true love is proven by action, let the last twelve lines carry the entire poem's meaning without",

      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### What's Alive\n\nThe final section is the strongest work here. \"Barefoot steps / on hardwood: snap-tap-snap, each floorboard / saying its one thing\" \u2014 that line earns its place through rhythmic precision and plainness of diction. The barefoot pouring at the end (\"You pour without being asked\") lands because it's grounded in a specific physical act rather than explained.\n\nThe radiator legs ticking \"every thirteen seconds against the baseboard\" is observed with enough specificity to feel like an actual sensory memory, not a decorative detail. That precision is the poem's core method \u2014 small, unromanticized things that only two people who have been together for years would notice.\n\n### What Isn't Working\n\n**Redundancy / structural bloat (lines 27\u201330):**\n> Through the door I hear barefoot steps\n> on hardwood: snap-tap-snap-tap. I can hear them\n> through the door although you make no sound.\n> Not urgency, not wanting anything more than\n> the house holds open without saying.\n\nThis passage explains what it already showed. \"Not urgency\" and \"without saying\" are editorializing \u2014 they tell the reader how to feel about something that required zero explanation from image. Cut or compress entirely: let the pouring speak for itself. The barefoot tapping is already doing the work of quiet presence; \"I can hear them\" adds nothing.\n\n**Clich\u00e9 proximity / weak line break (line 26):**\n> Steam thinning already.\n>\n> You tilt \u2014 a half-inch drop before your wrist releases it,\n> that particular stillness before something falls.\n\n\"Steam thinning already\" is close to the \"no name yet\" passage earlier \u2014 vague, decorative, and self-explanatory. The break after \"already\" creates no tension or surprise; steam thinning is its own action. Consider merging this into the pouring line or sharpening what follows so the trailing edge of steam becomes more surprising.\n\n**Abstraction / abstraction-as-philosophy (lines 19\u201320):**\n> You wait for the faucet like waiting\n> for someone you expect to stay:\n> no urgency, no fidgeting, just the table\n> holding your cup the way a hand holds a stone.\n\n\"Waiting for someone you expect to stay\" is emotional summary where an image was needed. \"Holding your cup the way a hand holds a stone\" is a simile that collapses into clich\u00e9 \u2014 cold, heavy, unyielding. Replace with something as plain and specific as what precedes it: coffee poured from milk in a mug.\n\n**Direction**\n\nThe revised draft should be 15\u201320 lines at most. Cut any line that explains the image rather than extending or sharpening it. Trust the domestic details \u2014 the radiator legs, the floorboard clicks, the barefoot tapping, the pouring itself",
