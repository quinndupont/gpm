      "draft": "The pavement outside the place you left\nhas turned this morning like a wet dishcloth\ndragged across the counter \u2014 not yet puddled,\nnot yet anything I could step in.\n\nI'm standing at the crosswalk anyway.\nMy hands are open. The air is April-cold\nand full of it, and the first rain grains\nhit my thumb and roll down without touching me,\n\nwhich is something. Something no one asks for.\nThe mouth goes dry before the weather does,\nand I am swallowing empty air \u2014 four swallows,\nfive, a small bird dying in the throat of it.\n\nOn the window upstairs, a bead runs slow\nalong its leaded channel, stops halfway,\nholds there like an eye that won't decide.\nI could watch this longer. I could\n\nbut I'm walking east where the sidewalk\nhas already softened into something\nyou couldn't have recognized \u2014 wet but not yet\nthe word for it, just the gray going thinner,\n\nand a dust-elephant of a truck passes,\nits tarp pulled tight as skin over a face\nno one has seen since December.\nThe taste is there again: salt\n\nwithout the water. Without the thing\nthat might have washed it clean. Just\nthe trace left on the tongue like a name\nyou said to someone else and forgotten.\n\nI put my hand against the wetest part\nof the curb just to feel what I mean \u2014\nhow the concrete gives back everything\nit took, how the rain is only\n\nreporting weather. The actual rain\nis what I'm not. Somewhere in the afternoon\na fire will start and no one will call it smoke yet,\nand by then the first storm has already passed,\n\nhas already gone inside a glass of water\nbrought to a window no one is looking at,\nwhere it sits with its small, clear arguments \u2014\nthe glass, the rain, the dust between them\n\nnegotiating what amounts to.",
      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### What's Alive\n\nThe central conceit \u2014 rain as something that erodes memory without washing it clean, the specific physical detail of a dry mouth encountering wet concrete at midday before anyone has an umbrella \u2014 is genuinely strong. The poem earns its title by staying inside small, unglamorous observation: \"the first rain grains / hit my thumb and roll down without touching me.\" That line does real work.\n\nThe bead running slow on the windowpane (line 15\u201318) also lands well because it stays concrete \u2014 an eye that won't decide, a liquid suspended in glass. The truck with its pulled-back tarp is a sharp detail for the world outside the speaker's grief.\n\nThe closing image of water inside a glass \"negotiating what amounts to\" has genuine compression and ambiguity, which risks obscurity but earns it through accumulated specificity.\n\n### What Isn't Working\n\n**1. Excessive line length / syntactic sprawl (lines 5\u201324).**\nThis is the poem's central structural problem. The brief asked for \"no more than two sentences per line ever.\" Many lines exceed that by a wide margin, and the prose sentence fragments are doing too much too late:\n- \"I could watch this longer. I could\" \u2014 dead end, no consequence\n- \"how the concrete gives back everything / it took, how the rain is only\" \u2014 summary where the poem should be arriving through image\n- The final paragraph (lines 25\u201331) reads like a restatement of what came before, not an advance\n\n**Direction:** Strip every line to one or two clauses. Let each image do its own work without commentary. \"I could watch this longer\" is the poem telling us something it hasn't shown yet.\n\n**2. Sentimentality / self-explanation (lines 19\u201331).**\nThe second half abandons concrete detail for emotional summary:\n- \"salt / without the water\" \u2014 obvious\n- \"Just / the trace left on the tongue like a name / you said to someone else and forgotten.\" \u2014 this is grief explained, not enacted. The dry mouth had already done that work in line 3.\n- \"The actual rain / is what I'm not\" \u2014 personified and announced\n\n**Direction:** Cut every sentence that names the feeling or interprets the image.

That's a precise, strange image. The truck with the pulled-back tarp (lines 23\u201325) also works: \"dust-elephant\" is unglamorous and specific enough.\n\n### What Isn't Working\n\n**1. Excessive line length / syntactic sprawl (throughout revision).**\nThe revised draft runs longer lines almost everywhere, abandoning the constraint that made the previous version worth revisiting. Lines 5\u201324 in particular are prose sentence fragments padded with filler: \"I could watch this longer\" exists only to fill space before arriving at the truck. \"No one is walking east where the sidewalk / has already softened into something\" \u2014 the line breaks here do no work; they don't create tension, surprise, or enjambment energy. Each line should either complete a clause or cut.\n\n**Direction:** Return to the constraint: 12\u201316 lines, no more than two clauses per line ever, minimal punctuation. Let each image arrive in its own sentence fragment \u2014 \"a bead runs slow\" / \"stops halfway\" / *end of line*. No connecting tissue between images; let white space do that work.\n\n**2. Sentimentality and self-explanation (lines 19\u201331).**\nThe second half abandons the poem's best quality: concrete observation, and replaces it with emotional summary:\n- \"salt / without the water\" \u2014 obvious\n- \"Just / the trace left on the tongue like a name / you said to someone else and forgotten.\" \u2014 this is grief explained, not enacted.
