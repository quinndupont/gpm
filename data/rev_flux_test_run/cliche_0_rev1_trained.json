He doesn't look up.\n\nI watch his shoulders come off his shirt\nat dinner, how the light catches\nthe exact same place each evening\u2014\na small dent above the blade of his ribcage,\n\na crease he makes without thinking.\nI could trace that with my thumb\nand not know what I was measuring.\n\nBut here's the thing: neither of us says\n*a pot burned itself.* We just eat,\nsilently, and the burning stays\ninside its own small circle on the stove\n\nlike a bruise no one will see. Twenty years\nof this\u2014my coffee, his shoes\nalways crossed beneath the chair\u2014\nand then he sits back in his chair\nand something has shifted\nthe way a river shifts\nits channel when it finds\na softer bank.\n\nI turn my head slightly.\nHe turns with it.\n\nNow we are both looking at the window\nwhere rain is not falling yet,\nbut the glass holds the exact\nshape of where it would fall\u2014how heavy\nit must feel, how ordinary,\nhow much the house expects.\n\nHe doesn't say a word.

      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe final four lines earn everything the poem has been building toward:\n\n> We sit like this for several seconds / the way you hold still when you hear / a bird outside and neither of you / has ever heard it before\u2014\n\nThis is the poem's real engine \u2014 not because of the idea, but because it trusts silence. The comparison to holding still for a sound achieves something precise: it makes stillness *felt* through anticipation rather than explanation.\n\n> then the window is just a window again,\n\nThe deflation is devastating. The metaphor collapses back into literalness with genuine force. This is where the poem's argument lives \u2014 that what seemed extraordinary was never anything but glass doing its job.\n\n> ordinary as the laces on his shoes.\n\nThat final parallel closes the whole arc in three words. It doesn't need to say \"I love you.\" The laces have been crossed for twenty years; they're still crossed. That's the declaration.\n\nThe poem is strongest when it stays inside domestic objects and gestures \u2014 the burned pot, the ribcage dent, the way he crosses his ankles. These are specific, and they carry weight without needing to announce themselves.\n\n---\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Sentimentality / Overexplaining (lines 1\u20134):**\n> He ties his shoes and the laces stay\n> exactly where he puts them\u2014\n> that's how I know. Not from anything said,\n> but from what happens when no one asks.\n\nThe poem tells us it's going to be about unspoken love, then immediately *explains* its own theme. \"That's how I know\" is a narrator stepping in to narrate. Cut or radically compress \u2014 the action of laces staying put does the work already. Let the reader arrive at the insight without being told there is an insight.\n\n**Abstraction creeping in (lines 13\u201316):**\n> something charred and specific,\n> like a promise that had dried up\n> and been forgotten by whatever\n> was making it.\n\nThe poem shifts into abstract metaphor \u2014 \"promise,\" \"dried up\" \u2014 right when it should be staying with the physical object. The burned pot is *the* thing. Name or describe it. \"Whatever was making it\" is pure filler, a placeholder for something the poet hasn't yet found.\n\n**Clich\u00e9:**\n> how much the house expects.\n\nThis line reaches for profundity and lands on sentimentality. It tells us what the poem has already shown \u2014 that routine is expectation. Cut or replace with an image as concrete as \"laces staying put.\"\n\n**Weak transition (line 26):**\n> Twenty years / of this\u2014\n\nThe ellipsis before the list risks vagueness. Name one more object, one more gesture. The accumulation in lines 27\u201330 works; give it its full weight by",
