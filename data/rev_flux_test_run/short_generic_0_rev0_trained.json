  "final_poem": "Rain, rain\u2014your whisper on the pane\nis not the sound I thought it would become.\nI expected you to fall in one clean stream,\nthe kind of weather you see drawn, not worn.\n\nBut this is different. Each drop strikes lace\nacross the glass as if remembering\nhow thin the line between us stands. You trace\nyour fingers through the quiet I was making.\n\nI like that\u2014how you're not the expected grace,\n\nbut something split, arrested, almost caught.\nThe way a creek runs full when someone's at the gate,\nnot yet at the house but turning, pulling back,\nas if to say: did you want more? Did you?\n\nYou taught me how to listen past the fact:\nthe rain on leaves is not the same as on slate.\nOn grass it comes as if the ground were fact\nand you could land anywhere in its plate.\n\nI'll write about the window, then I won't\u2014\nwill write instead about the sound you make\nwhen intercepting gutter metal. That's the part\nI didn't know\u2014I'd have gone on making\n\nempty rooms and parlor lights left on,\nthe usual warmth I try to keep around me\nlike a coat I've buttoned wrong, and wear\nanyway, because that's how I keep from being\n\njust air. But you\u2014your real sound teaches\nI was building walls against a different storm.\n\nNow I can't stop thinking of the roof\nas if it were a skin, taut and alive,\nand you were just below it, tapping\nwith the precise rhythms only weather knows,\n\nas if to say: I'm here. I'm leaving.\nFeel me going. Feel how thin\n\nthe material is between us\u2014how the house\nis not protection but the thing that makes\nthe noise when you forget to close the door,\nwhen you let the whole damn building hum\n\nwith what I'd call longing, except it was rain,\nwas just rain on a tin roof in the dark,\n\nand all I had was the window seat,\nmy back against cold glass, the wet sound\npushing through the seams. I held still.\nI think that's when I started listening right.",
