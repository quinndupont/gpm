How come to tell this tale of mine,\nSuch rage and such pity in thy song\u2014that the winds are always right upon me. \nHow I did yearn that once these trees could rise before my eyes; but now am forced by them at last not alone: how many who have loved as well might be forgotten here - to seek refuge onward with this breath, whose fire is born and blow'd back from Africa into their souls. Forsooth! I will go beyond the moon\u2019s pale eye tonight\u2014\nFor ever in these woods of my soul are sighing pines that still remember; for never more can we touch each other - O you who flew on wings, so vast and wildly-lashed with fury.

The speaker describes a scirocco wind as a \"cloud-gathering spirit\" and personifies it as a \"demon loosed from hell,\" weaving a vivid, almost mythic narrative. The language is rich, and the poem blends nature, emotion, and metaphor in a way that feels original and imaginative. The creative use of sensory details and the metaphorical transformation of the wind into a destructive force elevates it to the highest level.\n\n---\n\n### **2. \"The Rat And The Oyster\" by Jean de La Fontaine (Rating: 4)**  \n**Creativity**: A fable with a clever allegorical structure. The story of the rat and the oyster highlights hubris and misinterpretation through humor and irony. The poem\u2019s creativity lies in its use of a simple narrative to convey a universal moral, combined with vivid, unexpected imagery (e.g., the oyster \u201cbreathing, and drank the air\u2019s perfume\u201d). The allegory is cleverly executed, making it a standout example of creative storytelling.\n\n---\n\n### **3. \"Three Weeks Old\" by Algernon Charles Swinburne (Rating: 4)**  \n**Creativity**: This lyrical poem uses a rose as a metaphor for love and life, with rich, sensory imagery (\"bright, bold, and bold\") and a contemplative tone. The creativity lies in", "error": null, "elapsed_sec": 64.08891154208686, "eval_count": 2000, "eval_duration_ns": 51068413999, "response_stats": {"chars": 1455, "words": 233, "sentences": 14, "paragraphs": 7}, "parsed_scores": []}

work in the field,\nAnd one to the other his passion revealed--\nAs the white barley bowed to the stroke of his scythe,\nHe burst out in accents exultingly blithe--\n\"I have wooed a young maid!--I have wooed and I've won,\nOn a lovelier face never glanced yon bright sun;\nTo the tall stately cedar my love I'll compare,\nWith her eyes' shaded glory, her long raven hair,\nAnd her bosom as white as the snow when it gleams\nOn Lebanon's heights, ere washed down by the streams.\nShe has ravished and filled my rapt soul with delight;\nShe's more dear to my heart than yon heavens to my sight.\"--\n\"And who is the chosen?\" his comrade replied,\nWhilst the deepest of crimson his swarthy cheek dyed,\nHis severed lips trembled, his eagle eye fell\nWith a glance on his kinsman that urged him to tell.--\n\"'Tis Iddo's bright daughter!\"--The words were scarce said--\nAt the feet of his brother young Simeon lay dead.--\nIt was but one blow on those temples so fair,\nOne fierce cry of anger and jealous despair;\nAnd shuddering with horror his stern rival stood,\nAnd gazed on those features disfigured with blood.--\nWeep, fratricide, weep!--'tis in vain that you cast\nYour arms round that pale form, the struggle is past;\n'Tis in vain that chilled heart to your bosom you press,\nIts stillness increases your frantic distress.\nYou have scattered the gems in youth's beautiful crown,\nAnd his sun at mid-day has in darkness gone down;\nHe never shall bind for your false love a wreath,\nThe hand of the bridegroom is stiffened in death.\nThen dash from those wild eyes the fast-flowing tear,\nAnd fly!--for the City of Refuge is near.--\nThere's a murmur of voices, a shout on the wind,\nFly! fly! the Avenger of Blood is behind!--\nHe fled like an arrow just launched from the bow,\nO'erwhelm'd with remorse and distracted with woe;\nThe victim of passion--he'd gladly give all\nLife's dearest enjoyments that hour to recall.\nThe stain on his hands added wings to his flight,\nAs onward he sped through the shadows of night,\nAnd his startled ear caught in the wind's fitful moan,\nAs it swept through the forest, a faint dying groan;\nThe leaves rustling near sent a chill to his heart,\nAnd oft backward he glanced with an agonized start,\nAnd felt on his throat, parched and swollen with dread,\nThe soul-thrilling grasp of the phantom-like dead.\nThat pang was too great for the sinner to bear,\nAnd his fears found a voice in wild shrieks of despair!\nBut the night and its long noon of horrors is past,\nA broad line of light on the blue hills is cast,\nAnd the city of refuge before him appears,\nLike a beacon of hope, giving rest to his fears--\n\"But hark!--the avenger of blood is at hand;\nDost thou hear the loud shouts of his death-dooming band?\nThe trampling of horses rings sharp on the breeze,\nAnd armour is glancing at times through the trees;\nOn! on! for thy life!--if they compass the plain,\nThy sentence is sealed and all rescue is vain?\"--\nHe strains every nerve--he redoubles his speed,\nAnd strength is supplied in the moment of need,\nThe race is for life--and the city is won,\nEre its broad towers reflect the first beams of the sun.--\nOne proud glance of triumph the fugitive threw\nOn the band of pursuers that burst on his view,\nHe shook his clenched hand--and a tremulous cry\nRose and died on his pale lips their wrath to defy;\nBut the effort, too mighty, has severed in twain\nHis heart-strings--he staggers and sinks to the plain,\nAnd the cold dews that moisten that toil-crimsoned face\nTell that death claims his victim, the prize of the race,\nThat the city no refuge to guilt can afford--\nHe has found an Avenger of Blood in the Lord!"}, {"author": "Rose Hawthorne Lathrop", "title": "One And One.",

have wooed and I've won,\nOn a lovelier face never glanced yon bright sun;\nTo the tall stately cedar my love I'll compare,\nWith her eyes' shaded glory, her long raven hair,\nAnd her bosom as white

great for the sinner to bear,\nAnd his fears found a voice in wild shrieks of despair!\nBut the night and its long noon of horrors is past,\nA broad line of light on the blue hills is cast,\nAnd the

the sun.--\nOne proud glance of triumph the fugitive threw\nOn the band of pursuers that burst on his view,\nHe shook his clenched hand--and a tremulous cry\nRose and died on his pale lips their wrath to defy;\nBut the effort, too mighty, has severed in twain\nHis heart-strings--he staggers and sinks to the plain,\nAnd the cold dews that moisten that toil-crimsoned face\nTell that death claims his

work in the field,\nAnd one to the other his passion revealed--\nAs the white barley bowed to the stroke of his scythe,\nHe burst out in accents exultingly blithe--\n\"I have wooed a young maid!--I have wooed and I've won,\nOn a lovelier face never glanced yon bright sun;\nTo the tall stately cedar my love I'll compare,\nWith her eyes' shaded glory, her long raven hair,\nAnd her bosom as white as the snow when it gleams\nOn Lebanon's heights, ere washed down by the streams.\nShe has ravished and filled my rapt soul with delight;\nShe's more dear to my heart than yon heavens to my sight.\"--\n\"And who is the chosen?\" his comrade replied,\nWhilst the deepest of crimson his swarthy cheek dyed,\nHis severed lips trembled, his eagle eye fell\nWith a glance on his kinsman that urged him to tell.--\n\"'Tis Iddo's bright daughter!\"--The words were scarce said--\nAt the feet of his brother young Simeon lay dead.--\nIt was but one blow on those temples so fair,\nOne fierce cry of anger and jealous despair;\nAnd shuddering with horror his stern rival stood,\nAnd gazed on those features disfigured with blood.--\nWeep, fratricide, weep!--'tis in vain that you cast\nYour arms round that pale form, the struggle is past;\n'Tis in vain that chilled heart to your bosom you press,\nIts stillness increases your frantic distress.\nYou have scattered the gems in youth's beautiful crown,\nAnd his sun at mid-day has in darkness gone down;\nHe never shall bind for your false love a wreath,\nThe hand of the bridegroom is stiffened in death.\nThen dash from those wild eyes the fast-flowing tear,\nAnd fly!--for the City of Refuge is near.--\nThere's a murmur of voices, a shout on the wind,\nFly! fly! the Avenger of Blood is behind!--\nHe fled like an arrow just launched from the bow,\nO'erwhelm'd with remorse and distracted with woe;\nThe victim of passion--he'd gladly give all\nLife's dearest enjoyments that hour to recall.\nThe stain on his hands added wings to his flight,\nAs onward he sped through the shadows of night,\nAnd his startled ear caught in the wind's fitful moan,\nAs it swept through the forest, a faint dying groan;\nThe leaves rustling near sent a chill to his heart,\nAnd oft backward he glanced with an agonized start,\nAnd felt on his throat, parched and swollen with dread,\nThe soul-thrilling grasp of the phantom-like dead.\nThat pang was too great for the sinner to bear,\nAnd his fears found a voice in wild shrieks of despair!\nBut the night and its long noon of horrors is past,\nA broad line of light on the blue hills is cast,\nAnd the city of refuge before him appears,\nLike a beacon of hope, giving rest to his fears--\n\"But hark!--the avenger of blood is at hand;\nDost thou hear the loud shouts of his death-dooming band?\nThe trampling of horses rings sharp on the breeze,\nAnd armour is glancing at times through the trees;\nOn! on! for thy life!--if they compass the plain,\nThy sentence is sealed and all rescue is vain?\"--\nHe strains every nerve--he redoubles his speed,\nAnd strength is supplied in the moment of need,\nThe race is for life--and the city is won,\nEre its broad towers reflect the first beams of the sun.--\nOne proud glance of triumph the fugitive threw\nOn the band of pursuers that burst on his view,\nHe shook his clenched hand--and a tremulous cry\nRose and died on his pale lips their wrath to defy;\nBut the effort, too mighty, has severed in twain\nHis heart-strings--he staggers and sinks to the plain,\nAnd the cold dews that moisten that toil-crimsoned face\nTell that death claims his victim, the prize of the race,\nThat the city no refuge to guilt can afford--\nHe has found an Avenger of Blood in the Lord!"}, {"author": "Rose Hawthorne Lathrop", "title": "One And One.",

In **Discourse Grubb**'s \"The Disguised Voice,\" we observe an implicit commentary on censorship in music, with characters that navigate societal expectations under authoritative scrutiny. While seemingly unrelated to madness or wise governance at first glance, the text parallels a broader narrative where wisdom is constrained by power structures and voices are muffled\u2014thematically linking insanity's struggle for expression with societal silencing practices across eras.\n\n2. The absence of an endnote in Grubb\u2019s poem indicates not just forgetfulness or oversight but a disruption, potentially signifying the transient nature of human endeavor and legacy\u2014a concept echoed throughout history wherein knowledge once thought eternal is relegated to obscurity by time.\n\n3. **Anna Mowry**'s \"The Secret Rewards\" cleverly integrates personal experience with broader societal observations, evoking the disjunction between individual struggles and collective expectations in patriarchal settings. The persona\u2019s journey from childhood into marriage represents a microcosm for examining gendered role assignment\u2014akin to madmen adapting under duress or wise men reluctantly stepping up as regents when faced with anarchy, suggesting the artificiality of prescribed social roles and identities shaped by environment.\n\n4. **Alice Tremayne**'s sonnet provides a candid exploration into how external trappings like attire can impact societal perception\u2014lauding personal attributes while critiquing superficial judgments reminiscent of madmen\u2019s fluctuating facades within Hessian uniformity. The speaker laments the reduction of human connection to surface glamor, paralleling wise men and lunatics who must navigate an environment where appearances are as transient in their social roles as they are on fabric\u2014underscoring societal preoccupations with aesthetics over substance across cultures.\n\n5. In **Thomas Gent**\u2019s brief but evocative piece, the grim portrait of winter and desolation encapsulates not only personal hardship (akin to \"little luck\" metaphorically symbolizing marginalized voices in historical context) but also mirror societal indifference\u2014drawing attention parallel between madmen's forced compliance with authoritarian rule and humanity\u2019s oftentimes blind adherence to social norms or disaster-driven survivalism.\n\n6. **Alfred Edward Housman** presents a contemplative look into self-perception amid societal judgment\u2014an intimate revelation on vanity paralleling how wise men might misjudge their influence within society and the universal human experience of reflection upon personal allure or detractors in times when such aspects may have been crucial for social mobility.\n\n7. Finally, **William Schwenck Gilbert**'s lament on his own appearance encapsulates existential musings over beauty standards\u2014a perennial theme resonating with the madmen\u2019s subjugation to public opinion as they attempt to navigate and conform within their societal roles in \u201cWhen I First Put This Uniform On.\u201d\n\nThroughout these text snippets, we witness recurrent themes of power dynamics between wisdom/wisdom's manifestations (madmen) versus imposed authority or misjudgment by society at large. The role reversals allude to a cyclical challenge in literature: where madness becomes insight and folly\u2014whether intentional within literary constructs like \"The Triumph of Time\" or societal commentaries as seen across the centuries, reflecting back upon each other for deeper understanding not only about self but also broader cultural narratives.\n\nIn conclusion, these disjoined texts collectively weave together to illustrate historical and universal reflections on humanity\u2019s struggle against authoritative forces, be they institutional or social. They reveal a nuanced interplay between madness as wisdom, societal beauty norms serving both adoration and derision, the cyclic nature of time affecting all levels\u2014from personal to political history\u2014and universal experiences with love loss, vanity, censorship, role expectations, indifference towards suffering, self-perception in a vain world.\n\nIn an age where wisdom seems ever more elusive and insanity increasingly becomes the vanguard of untold histories or disenfranchised narratives\u2014much like madmen seeking refuge within their own institutions as seen with Michelangelo di Lodovico Gilbert\u2019s musings on uniform attire\u2014these texts offer a complex tapestry for examining societal structures and our inherent responses to them. Each, in its unique way, acts not just as poetry but commentaries that serve time-transcending functions of reminding us about the cyclical struggle between individuality and imposed order within human cultures across ages past and present alike.\n\n---", "error": null, "elapsed_sec": 28.145804874948226, "eval_count": 1319, "eval_duration_ns": 19872825704, "response_stats": {"chars": 5751, "words": 788, "sentences": 28, "paragraphs": 15}, "parsed_scores": []}

in the field,\nAnd one to the other his passion revealed--\nAs the white barley bowed to the stroke of his scythe,\nHe burst out in accents exultingly blithe--\n\"I have wooed a young maid!--I have wooed and I've won,\nOn a lovelier face never glanced yon bright sun;\nTo the tall stately cedar my love I'll compare,\nWith her eyes' shaded glory, her long raven hair,\nAnd her bosom as white as the snow when it gleams\nOn Lebanon's heights, ere washed down by the streams.\nShe has ravished and filled my rapt soul with delight;\nShe's more dear to my heart than yon heavens to my sight.\"--\n\"And who is the chosen?\" his comrade replied,\nWhilst the deepest of crimson his swarthy cheek dyed,\nHis severed lips trembled, his eagle eye fell\nWith a glance on his kinsman that urged him to tell.--\n\"'Tis Iddo's bright daughter!\"--The words were scarce said--\nAt the feet of his brother young Simeon lay dead.--\nIt was but one blow on those temples so fair,\nOne fierce cry of anger and jealous despair;\nAnd shuddering with horror his stern rival stood,\nAnd gazed on those features disfigured with blood.--\nWeep, fratricide, weep!--'tis in vain that you cast\nYour arms round that pale form, the struggle is past;\n'Tis in vain that chilled heart to your bosom you press,\nIts stillness increases your frantic distress.\nYou have scattered the gems in youth's beautiful crown,\nAnd his sun at mid-day has in darkness gone down;\nHe never shall bind for your false love a wreath,\nThe hand of the bridegroom is stiffened in death.\nThen dash from those wild eyes the fast-flowing tear,\nAnd fly!--for the City of Refuge is near.--\nThere's a murmur of voices, a shout on the wind,\nFly! fly! the Avenger of Blood is behind!--\nHe fled like an arrow just launched from the bow,\nO'erwhelm'd with remorse and distracted with woe;\nThe victim of passion--he'd gladly give all\nLife's dearest enjoyments that hour to recall.\nThe stain on his hands added wings to his flight,\nAs onward he sped through the shadows of night,\nAnd his startled ear caught in the wind's fitful moan,\nAs it swept through the forest, a faint dying groan;\nThe leaves rustling near sent a chill to his heart,\nAnd oft backward he glanced with an agonized start,\nAnd felt on his throat, parched and swollen with dread,\nThe soul-thrilling grasp of the phantom-like dead.\nThat pang was too great for the sinner to bear,\nAnd his fears found a voice in wild shrieks of despair!\nBut the night and its long noon of horrors is past,\nA broad line of light on the blue hills is cast,\nAnd the city of refuge before him appears,\nLike a beacon of hope, giving rest to his fears--\n\"But hark!--the avenger of blood is at hand;\nDost thou hear the loud shouts of his death-dooming band?\nThe trampling of horses rings sharp on the breeze,\nAnd armour is glancing at times through the trees;\nOn! on! for thy life!--if they compass the plain,\nThy sentence is sealed and all rescue is vain?\"--\nHe strains every nerve--he redoubles his speed,\nAnd strength is supplied in the moment of need,\nThe race is for life--and the city is won,\nEre its broad towers reflect the first beams of the sun.--\nOne proud glance of triumph the fugitive threw\nOn the band of pursuers that burst on his view,\nHe shook his clenched hand--and a tremulous cry\nRose and died on his pale lips their wrath to defy;\nBut the effort, too mighty, has severed in twain\nHis heart-strings--he staggers and sinks to the plain,\nAnd the cold dews that moisten that toil-crimsoned face\nTell that death claims his victim, the prize of the race,\nThat the city no refuge to guilt can afford--\nHe has found an Avenger of Blood in the Lord!"}, {"author": "Rose Hawthorne Lathrop", "title": "One And One.",

Here's a thematic and contextual analysis of the poems:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Nature and Memory**  \n- **\"Sweet Fern\" by John Greenleaf Whittier**:  \n  This poem explores the power of natural scents to evoke memory and emotional resonance. The \"sweet fern\" acts as a catalyst, transporting the speaker back to his childhood, blending sensory experience with nostalgia. The poem underscores how nature can serve as a bridge between past and present, linking personal history to universal themes of time and memory.\n\n- **\"Black Earth\" by Marianne Moore**:  \n  Moore\u2019s work delves into the interplay between the self and the natural world. The \"black earth\" symbolizes both physical and metaphorical grounding, reflecting the speaker\u2019s identity as shaped by environment and experience. The poem\u2019s introspective tone and vivid imagery highlight the tension between individuality and the external world, emphasizing how nature and human existence are inextricably linked.\n\n---\n\n### **2. War and Conflict**  \n- **\"Chattanooga\" by Herman Melville**:  \n  Set during the American Civil War, this poem captures the chaos and determination of battle. Melville\u2019s focus on Grant\u2019s strategic vision and the soldiers\u2019 resilience underscores the human cost of war while celebrating the courage required to overcome adversity. The imagery of \"summit-cannon\" and \"dark dots creep\" evokes the scale and intensity of conflict.\n\n- **\"Sonnet. On Seeing A Young Lady...\" by Thomas Gent**:  \n  While not directly about war, this sonnet reflects on the fragility of mental health and societal expectations. The speaker laments the loss of a loved one\u2019s sanity, questioning the role of beauty and love in destabilizing the mind. It touches on themes of tragedy and the societal neglect of mental health.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Identity and Resilience**  \n- **\"Black Earth\" (continued)**:  \n  The speaker\u2019s embrace of their \"elephant skin\" and \"black glass\" metaphorizes resilience. The poem suggests that identity is forged through hardship, with the \"patina of circumstance\" enriching the self. This theme of transformation through experience is central to the poem\u2019s message.\n\n- **\"The Sonnets Of Tommaso Campanella\" by Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni**:  \n  This work critiques societal and political chaos, using a parable about astronomers and madmen to explore the tension between wisdom and power. The poem questions the role of authority and the cyclical nature of human folly, reflecting on how societies oscillate between order and disorder.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Mortality and Transience**  \n- **\"Now dreary dawns the eastern light\" by Alfred Edward Housman**:  \n  A somber reflection on the passage of time and human frailty. The poem\u2019s refrain\u2014\u201cLittle is the luck I've had\u201d\u2014captures a sense of existential despair, emphasizing the inevitability of death and the universality of suffering. Housman\u2019s work often grapples with the transient nature of life and the futility of human ambition.\n\n- **\"Sonnet. On Seeing A Young Lady...\" (continued)**:  \n  The poem also touches on mortality through its depiction of mental illness as a form of \"wreck\" and the speaker\u2019s anguish over the loss of a loved one\u2019s sanity. It juxtaposes beauty with fragility, highlighting the impermanence of life and love.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Social Critique and Empathy**  \n- **\"When I First Put This Uniform On\" by William Schwenck Gilbert**:  \n  A satirical take on the romanticization of military life, this poem critiques societal perceptions of heroism and the performative nature of uniforms. Gilbert\u2019s humor underscores the disconnect between public ideals and private struggles, questioning the glorification of war and the pressures of conformity.\n\n- **\"The Sonnets Of Tommaso Campanella\" (continued)**:  \n  The poem\u2019s critique of power and societal decay reflects a broader concern with justice and the erosion of wisdom in the face of chaos. It invites reflection on the responsibilities of those in authority and the consequences of neglecting moral guidance.\n\n---\n\n### **Common Themes and Literary Techniques**  \n- **Imagery and Symbolism**: Many poems use natural elements (e.g., earth, light, scents) or metaphors (e.g., \"black glass,\" \"elephant skin\") to convey complex emotions and ideas.  \n- **Reflection and Introspection**: A recurring theme is the internal struggle between individual experience and external forces, whether societal, natural, or historical.  \n- **Historical Context**: Poems like \"Chattanooga\" and \"The Sonnets Of Tommaso Campanella\" are rooted in specific historical moments, blending personal reflection with broader societal commentary.  \n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**  \nThese poems collectively reflect the enduring human preoccupation with identity, memory, conflict, and resilience. Whether exploring the quiet beauty of nature, the brutality of war, or the fragility of the mind, the authors use vivid imagery and introspective reflection to illuminate the complexities of existence. Their works invite readers to engage with both the personal and universal, bridging the gap between individual experience and collective human struggles.", "error": null, "elapsed_sec": 52.198995415936224, "eval_count": 1518, "eval_duration_ns": 38872707519, "response_stats": {"chars": 5281, "words": 776, "sentences": 46, "paragraphs": 20}, "parsed_scores": []}

Beside it, three\nWalked with no word: A woman with bowed head,\nA young girl, old before her youth had fled,\nHugging a sleeping baby; near her knee\nA gaunt hound trotted. Any one could see\nThe wagon held their all, from box to bed.\nSlowly they creaked into the mountain town\nAnd asked their way. Their men had all been killed,\nFather and brother, at some mountain ball,\nThis girl the cause: a man had shot them down,\nThe father of the infant. As God willed,\nThey sought another State, and that was all.\n\n--- POEM 5: \"If We But Knew.\" by Freeman Edwin Miller ---\nIf we but knew the weary way,\nThe poisoned paths of hostile hate,\nThe roughened roads of fiercest fate,\nThrough which our brother's journey lay,\nWould we condemn, as now we do,\nHis faults and failures,--if we knew?\nWould we forget the shadows grim,\nThe lonely hours of grief and pain,\nThe follies dead, the pleasures slain,\nThe tears and toils that hindered him,\nAnd only prize the deeds that grew\nTo mighty conquest, if we knew?\nWould careless hand sow tares of strife,\nAmid the blooms of happy care,\nAnd plant, in spite of sigh and prayer,\nWild thorns amid the blameless life,\nTill sorrows rule the nations through,\nWith scarce a rival, if we knew?\nWould we be quicker with our praise,\nAnd gladly give the greatest meeds\nAs recompense for noble deeds,\nAnd heroes crown with brightest bays,\nAnd slay all foes that hearts imbue\nWith doubt and weakness, if we knew?\nFrom lofty kings would constant worth\nOn peasant brows their crowns bestow,\nAnd rising from her overthrow\nEternal justice rule the earth,\nWhile right would strip the favored few\nTo bless the many, if we knew?\nIf we but knew! Ah, well-a-day!\nFrom lives that murmur, full of ills,\nBehind the shadows of the hills,\nGod hides our brother's heart away;\nAnd we shall know in vales of rest\nThat His eternal ways are best!\n\n--- POEM 6: \"Lost in the Flood\" by Henry Kendall ---\nWhen God drave the ruthless waters\nFrom our cornfields to the sea,\nCame she where our wives and daughters\nSobbed their thanks on bended knee.\nHidden faces! there ye found her\nMute as death, and staring wild\nAt the shadow waxing round her\nLike the presence of her child\nOf her drenched and drowning child!\nDark thoughts live when tears won't gather;\nWho can tell us what she felt?\nIt was human, O my Father,\nIf she blamed Thee while she knelt!\nEver, as a benediction\nFell like balm on all and each,\nRose a young face whose affliction\nChoked and stayed the founts of speech\nStayed and shut the founts of speech!\nOften doth she sit and ponder\nOver gleams of happy hair!\nHow her white hands used to wander,\nLike a flood of moonlight there!\nLord our Lord!

Beside it, three\nWalked with no word: A woman with bowed head,\nA young girl, old before her youth had fled,\nHugging a sleeping baby; near her knee\nA gaunt hound trotted. Any one could see\nThe wagon held their all, from box to bed.\nSlowly they creaked into the mountain town\nAnd asked their way. Their men had all been killed,\nFather and brother, at some mountain ball,\nThis girl the cause: a man had shot them down,\nThe father of the infant. As God willed,\nThey sought another State, and that was all.\n\n--- POEM 5: \"If We But Knew.\" by Freeman Edwin Miller ---\nIf we but knew the weary way,\nThe poisoned paths of hostile hate,\nThe roughened roads of fiercest fate,\nThrough which our brother's journey lay,\nWould we condemn, as now we do,\nHis faults and failures,--if we knew?\nWould we forget the shadows grim,\nThe lonely hours of grief and pain,\nThe follies dead, the pleasures slain,\nThe tears and toils that hindered him,\nAnd only prize the deeds that grew\nTo mighty conquest, if we knew?\nWould careless hand sow tares of strife,\nAmid the blooms of happy care,\nAnd plant, in spite of sigh and prayer,\nWild thorns amid the blameless life,\nTill sorrows rule the nations through,\nWith scarce a rival, if we knew?\nWould we be quicker with our praise,\nAnd gladly give the greatest meeds\nAs recompense for noble deeds,\nAnd heroes crown with brightest bays,\nAnd slay all foes that hearts imbue\nWith doubt and weakness, if we knew?\nFrom lofty kings would constant worth\nOn peasant brows their crowns bestow,\nAnd rising from her overthrow\nEternal justice rule the earth,\nWhile right would strip the favored few\nTo bless the many, if we knew?\nIf we but knew! Ah, well-a-day!\nFrom lives that murmur, full of ills,\nBehind the shadows of the hills,\nGod hides our brother's heart away;\nAnd we shall know in vales of rest\nThat His eternal ways are best!\n\n--- POEM 6: \"Lost in the Flood\" by Henry Kendall ---\nWhen God drave the ruthless waters\nFrom our cornfields to the sea,\nCame she where our wives and daughters\nSobbed their thanks on bended knee.\nHidden faces! there ye found her\nMute as death, and staring wild\nAt the shadow waxing round her\nLike the presence of her child\nOf her drenched and drowning child!\nDark thoughts live when tears won't gather;\nWho can tell us what she felt?\nIt was human, O my Father,\nIf she blamed Thee while she knelt!\nEver, as a benediction\nFell like balm on all and each,\nRose a young face whose affliction\nChoked and stayed the founts of speech\nStayed and shut the founts of speech!\nOften doth she sit and ponder\nOver gleams of happy hair!\nHow her white hands used to wander,\nLike a flood of moonlight there!\nLord our Lord! Thou know'st her weakness:\nGive her faith that she may pray;\nAnd the subtle strength of meekness,\nLest she falter by the way\nFalter, fainting, by the way!\n'Darling!' saith she, wildly moaning\nWhere the grass-grown silence lies,\n'Is there rest from sobs and groaning\nRest with you beyond the skies?\nChild of mine, so far above me!\nLate it waxeth dark and late;\nWill the love with which I love thee,\nLift me where you sit and wait\nDarling!

My heart thrums to muse and rhyme of olden days where bards with lyres sang,  \nTheir words did weave the very sinews 'twixt love's guileless lays; such treasures from that golden past I long recall--oh! how my spirit soars high.  \nFor lo and behold, in every heartfelt verse a seed of wisdom grew to bind mankind together under God\u2019s watchful skies: respect for the divine above as well-guided love amongst brethren below; where once were songs that called warriors' souls homeward from bloodshed fields.  \nO Muse, stand proud at my ear! Whisper your timeless counsel yet--oh sweet serenity through mine own tongue to channel back the essence of our cherished art: let not honor wither nor creativity be ensnared by fear's dark shroud; for it is in the pure melody that virtue stands revealed, an unblemished mirror held up unto ourselves.\n\nI bid thee heed my tribute paid to this transcendent gift of oration and rhyme - wherein lies both solace sweet: a sonnet\u2019s embrace holds sway o'er passion fierce as fire; while tragedy deep within the heart, in sorrowful lines finds release. In metaphor bold I find my spirit stoked to flame\u2014whereon our lives and thoughts together flow 'neath heaven's unfailing gaze! A verse mayhap can mend a quarrelsome tongue or soothe a king\u2019s haughty brow; but most of all, it reaches out beyond the mortal flesh into timeless souls wherein we touch one another near eternally\u2014as brothers 'neath this vast and ever-turning azure expanse.\n\nI love you Muse! This tribute ends not here: to honor thee still with gratitude full I give my humble verse; in tender homage for the gift of eloquent speech, which doth preserve our most precious human essence 'midst a world that oft forgets it exists. In every line and syllable carved upon this stage we share\u2014I offer reverence back to thy divine grace: an offering from one who cherishes these gifts as jewels within his soul's deepest trove; for with them can humanity traverse the span of joys, sorrows wide.\n\nAnd henceforth shall I wield thine artful tongue! With reverent hands my words do paint upon this hallowed ground: a tribute paid to thee\u2014a shrine built on high from sounding hearts\u2019 unyoked chords and sweet refrains that reach through ages' ceaseless turns. It falls thusly here within the quiet humble pleadings of these parted lips, wherewith I vow never again silence our noble art; nor falter in my devout praise for thee eternal Muse whose wisdom flows as life-giving brooks\u2014through generations past and to those that yet remain unborn. \n\nOh sing then on this sacred boon of speech! For evermore I will seek refuge from the storms which rage without, in sanctuary found within thine endless realm where words wander free; their sovereign path unfettered by time's cruel hand\u2014a bastion against chaos and dread untimely death.\nSo here\u2019s my vow: that when the twilight comes calling near, I shall not be a mere mortal who has fled from darkness vast or faded memory where once did echo our grandest songs; but rather stand as keeper staunch of this precious legacy which stands guard o'er all men and kings alike. In praise\u2014and everlasting gratitude, I raise my voice in timeless hymn: to thee eternal Muse!\n--Edward Field", "error": null, "elapsed_sec": 21.779907625052147, "eval_count": 908, "eval_duration_ns": 13459714089, "response_stats": {"chars": 3424, "words": 580, "sentences": 20, "paragraphs": 7}, "parsed_scores": []}

Knickerbocker, Jr.* (Eugene Field) blend patriotic pride with camaraderie, highlighting friendship and shared cultural identity.  \n\n4. **Social Critique and Humor**:  \n   - *To John J. Knickerbocker, Jr.* uses lightheartedness to affirm enduring friendship despite physical distance, while *The Broom, The Shovel, The Poker, And The Tongs* employs whimsy to critique societal norms.  \n\n---\n\n### **How Can I Help?**  \nIf you have a specific question, such as:  \n- **Analysis of a particular poem** (e.g., themes, symbolism, or literary devices).  \n- **Comparison of authors or styles** (e.g., Lear vs. Cawein).  \n- **Historical context** (e.g., the role of poetry in 19th-century America).  \n- **Translation or interpretation of excerpts** (e.g., the waterfall\u2019s metaphor).  \n\nPlease let me know!

I have made\nA study of thee; and while I admire\nThe practised skill with which thy plans are laid,\nI can but wonder if thou dost not tire.\nWhy, I tire even of Hamlet and Macbeth!\nWhen overlong the season runs, I find\nThose master-scenes of passion, blood, and death,\nAfter a time do pall upon my mind.\nDost thou not tire of lifting up thine eyes\nTo read the story thou hast read so oft -\nOf ardent glances and deep quivering sighs,\nOf haughty faces suddenly grown soft?\nIs it not stale, oh, very stale, to thee,\nThe scene that follows? Hearts are much the same;\nThe loves of men but vary in degree -\nThey find no new expressions for the flame.\nThou must know all they utter ere they speak,\nAs I know Hamlet's part, whoever plays.\nOh, does it not seem sometimes poor and weak?\nI think thou must grow weary of their ways.\nI pity thee, Isaura! I would be\nThe humblest maiden with her dream untold\nRather than live a Queen of Hearts, like thee,\nAnd find life's rarest treasures stale and old.\nI pity thee; for now, let come what may,\nFame, glory, riches, yet life will lack all.\nWherewith can salt be salted? And what way\nCan life be seasoned after love doth pall?\n\n--- POEM 5: \"The Lion Grown Old.\" by Jean de La Fontaine ---\n[1]\nA lion, mourning, in his age, the wane\nOf might once dreaded through his wild domain,\nWas mock'd, at last, upon his throne,\nBy subjects of his own,\nStrong through his weakness grown.\nThe horse his head saluted with a kick;\nThe wolf snapp'd at his royal hide;\nThe ox, too, gored him in the side;\nThe unhappy lion, sad and sick,\nCould hardly growl, he was so weak.\nIn uncomplaining, stoic pride,\nHe waited for the hour of fate,\nUntil the ass approach'd his gate;\nWhereat, 'This is too much,' he saith;\n'I willingly would yield my breath;\nBut, ah! thy kick is double death!'\n\n--- POEM 6: \"Lines by Taj Mahomed\" by Laurence Hope (Adela Florence Cory Nicolson) ---\nThis passion is but an ember\nOf a Sun, of a Fire, long set;\nI could not live and remember,\nAnd so I love and forget.\nYou say, and the tone is fretful,\nThat my mourning days were few,\nYou call me over forgetful -\nMy God, if you only knew!\n\n--- POEM 7: \"In Fervent Praise Of Picnics\" by James Whitcomb Riley ---\nPicnics is fun 'at's purty hard to beat.\nI purt'-nigh ruther go to them than eat.\nI purt'-nigh ruther go to them than go\nWith our Charlotty to the Trick-Dog Show.\n\n--- POEM 8: \"Tread Softly\" by Joseph Horatio Chant ---\nIn the courts of truth tread softly,\nThough your tread be firm and bold;\nYour steps may awaken echoes,\nResounding through years untold.\nThe trend of the age is onward,\nAnd you should not lag behind;\nIf men's minds are bound with fetters,\nPerchance you may some unbind.\nOur creed, say you, needs revising,\nIn line with the growth of light;\nBe sure you have made real progress\nBefore you assume the right,\nBy stroke of pen, to unsettle\nThe faith of the long ago;\nFor many who err in judgment\nStand fast to the truth they know.\nYou bring from the mine rare jewels,\nThat you think the world should see;\nBut, perhaps, their estimation\nWith your own may not agree;\nThey may lack discrimination,\nAnd their worth may not discern;\nSo polish them at your leisure,\nAnd give the world time to learn.\nBefore you dig up the old tree\nThat sheltered in ages past\nThe earth's noblest men and women\nFrom the fury of the blast,\nSee that your sapling is rooted,\nAnd no borer at its base,\nAnd its boughs both strong and spreading,\nTo cover an erring race.\nBear down on the lever gently,\nOr the rock may be o'erturned!\nOr, perchance, your lever shattered,\nAnd little experience learned!\nTake time to adjust your fulcrum,\nThen thrust home your iron bar;\nBear down and the rock is lifted,\nIs lifted without a jar.\nYour views are, perhaps, exotic--\nYoung shoots from a tropic brain,\nThey need to be better rooted\nTo endure the wind and rain;\nYou may well admire the markings\nOn each graceful stem and leaf,\nBut if taken from \n[...truncated...]\n\n--- POEM 9: \"Tillie\" by Walter De La Mare ---\nOld Tillie Turveycombe\nSat to sew,\nJust where a patch of fern did grow;\nThere, as she yawned,\nAnd yawn wide did she,\nFloated some seed\nDown her gull-e-t;\nAnd look you once,\nAnd look you twice,\nPoor old Tillie\nWas gone in a trice.\nBut oh, when the wind\nDo a-moaning come,\n'Tis poor old Tillie\nSick for home;\nAnd oh, when a voice\nIn the mist do sigh,\nOld Tillie Turveycombe's\nFloating by.\n\n--- POEM 10: \"The West's Asleep.\" by Thomas Osborne Davis ---\nAir--The Brink of the White Rocks.\nI.\nWhen all beside a vigil keep,\nThe West's asleep, the West's asleep--\nAlas! and well may Erin weep,\nWhen Connaught lies in slumber deep.\nThere lake and plain smile fair and free,\n'Mid rocks--their guardian chivalry--\nSing oh! let man learn liberty\nFrom crashing wind and lashing sea.\nII.\nThat chainless wave and lovely land\nFreedom and Nationhood demand--\nBe sure, the great God never planned,\nFor slumbering slaves, a home so grand.\nAnd, long, a brave and haughty race\nHonoured and sentinelled the place--\nSing oh! not even their sons' disgrace\nCan quite destroy their glory's trace.\nIII.\nFor often, in O'Connor's van,\nTo triumph dashed each Connaught clan--\nAnd fleet as deer the Normans ran\nThrough Corlieu's Pass and Ardrahan.\nAnd later times saw deeds as brave;\nAnd glory guards Clanricarde's grave--\nSing oh! they died their land to save,\nAt Aughrim's slopes and Shannon's wave.\nIV.\nAnd if, when all a vigil keep,\nThe West's asleep, the West's asleep--\nAlas! and well may Erin weep,\nThat Connaught lies in slumber deep.\nBut, hark! some voice like thunder spake:\n\"The West's awake! the West's awake!\"--\n\"Sing oh! hurra! let England quake,\nWe'll watch till death for Erin's sake!\"\n\n--- POEM 11: \"Pompeii And Herculaneum.\" by Friedrich Schiller ---\nWhat wonder this?
