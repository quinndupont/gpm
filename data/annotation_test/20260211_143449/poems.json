    "text": "Fools can parrot-cry the prophet when the proof is close at hand,\nAnd the blind can see the danger when the foe is in the land!\nTruth was never cynicism, death or ruin's not a joke,\n'Told-you-so' is not a warning, Patriotism not a croak.\nBlame will aid no man nor country when the dark days come at last,\nAs with men so with a nation, and the warning time is past.\nOur great sins were of omission, and the dogs of war are loosed,\nAnd we all must stand together when those sins come home to roost.\nSince the cities are the cities and shall stand for evermore,\nLet us justify our being, be it peace or be it war.\nFor because we are the townsfolk, and have never ridden far\nShall we call the bush to aid us that has made us what we are?\nWestward went our brothers, fighting distance, drought, and loneliness\nWhile we lived in light and comfort knowing nothing of distress,\nWe who never shared the hardships when the sunset led them on,\nNow's our time, O street-bred people, with our faces to the dawn!\nThey have conquered with the cross-cut and the wedges and the maul,\nWith the spade and axe and mattock and the saddle-packs and all,\nThey have mighty work before them for the sake of you and me,\nLet us stand up to our duty! We're the Rearguard by the Sea.\nDays of gibes at 'street-bred people' by the street-bred bards are done,\nShall the man who lays the yard-stick never learn to lay the gun?\nShall the crouched type-writer toiling for his home in days like these\nTouch the button the less firmly when we play on other keys?\nWe have seen in many countries what the street-bred men can do,\nIn the desert, scrub and jungle they were men who battled through!\nHuman weeds of grand endurance winning where the strong men quailed,\nPigeon-chested leaders leading on where beef-born courage failed.\nStreet-bred people down the ages, beggars, mobs and democrats,\nFought through many desperate sieges (fought on horseflesh, dogs and rats)\nWhen their own cowed country failed them, then the city soul was proved,\n'Street-bred people' died in thousands for the cities that they loved.\nIn the days when strength was needed, days of pike and axe and sword,\nDaylight found the peaceful burghers ready, keeping watch and ward.\nClerks and tailors fought like heroes at the gates and in the trench,\n(Even Falstaff brought his herrings with some slaughter through the French).\nEvery man should have a cottage and a garden to defend,\nBut the 'should-be' is for ever, cities stand until the end,\nEvery farmer has a country that he loves when war-drums roll,\nEvery clerk may have a city that he loves with heart and soul.\nFat or lean, we all are sinners, lean or fat we all would be;\nHigh or low or lean or fatted, 'tis for Nationality.\nIt will be till all is ended, as it was since all began,\n'Tis the head and not the feathers! 'tis the heart and not the 'man'!"

    "text": "A voice peals in this end of night\nA phrase of notes resembling stars,\nSingle and spiritual notes of light.\nWhat call they at my window-bars?\nThe South, the past, the day to be,\nAn ancient infelicity.\nDarkling, deliberate, what sings\nThis wonderful one, alone, at peace?\nWhat wilder things than song, what things\nSweeter than youth, clearer than Greece,\nDearer than Italy, untold\nDelight, and freshness centuries old?\nAnd first first-loves, a multitude,\nThe exaltation of their pain;\nAncestral childhood long renewed;\nAnd midnights of invisible rain;\nAnd gardens, gardens, night and day,\nGardens and childhood all the way.\nWhat Middle Ages passionate,\nO passionless voice! What distant bells\nLodged in the hills, what palace state\nIllyrian! For it speaks, it tells,\nWithout desire, without dismay,\nSome morrow and some yesterday.\nAll-natural things! But more-Whence came\nThis yet remoter mystery?\nHow do these starry notes proclaim\nA graver still divinity?\nThis hope, this sanctity of fear?\nO innocent throat! O human ear!"
