      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe central conceit \u2014 a living creature listening to a dead person, and carrying away something only it knows \u2014 is genuinely compelling. The poem earns its ending: \"what passes through it / will not return\" lands because the whole preceding body has been building toward that absence without naming it directly.\n\nThe line \"a slot opens there, not loud but neither quiet\" is precise in a way most poems aren't. It refuses to fill the gap between sound and silence with any of the stock language from the brief (creaking floorboards, sobbing, darkness). The bullet hole metaphor inside it also works because it's doing physical work \u2014 you can see the opening, feel its emptiness.\n\nThe tablecloth crease (\"a crease in the tablecloth between them / where no one has smoothed flat\") is a quiet, earned detail. It captures tenderness without naming it. That restraint is what makes it effective.\n\nThe raven appears only once as noun and does nothing predictable with the word \"nevermore.\"\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Sentimentality / over-explanation (lines 13\u201314):**\n> **Something thinner, bearing no black feathers\u2014**\n> **some faint infrastructure of sound, the way a bone holds inside it the exact shape of flesh it fed.**\n\nThis is the poem explaining its own metaphor to the reader. \"Flesh it fed\" \u2014 that's personification doing work the image should do. Direction: cut or radically compress this passage. The bone holding shape is already strange and doesn't need the additional narrative of nourishment.\n\n**Abstraction bloat (lines 15\u201320):**\n> **His throat does something without his asking it. / A slot opens there, not loud but neither quiet,**  \n> **the kind of thing you'd feel discovering a wall's empty bullet hole.**  \n> **It is not her. It is the opposite\u2014**  \n> **a knock on something behind knocking, clean and wet,**  \n> **and he watches the raven with one eye**  \n> **the way you watch an object about to be knocked from a shelf:**  \n> **black shape doing nothing, riding the air / like anything that has no interest in staying.**\n\n\"Clean and wet,\" \"watching with one eye,\" \"riding the air\" \u2014 three images in quick succession that compete for attention without deepening each other. The raven passage (\"black shape doing nothing\") is close to clich\u00e9 (the bird as inert observer). Direction: choose *one* of these visual metaphors, or cut two. Let the final image of the raven drop from view do more work alone.\n\n**Weak line break (line 25):**\n> **The raven flies past the kitchen light,**  \n> **which is also hers\u2014the switch she always turned off\u2014and**\n\n\"Also\" is",
