      "draft": "From winter's heavy hand, we step\u2014  \nA thicket of frost cracks underfoot,\nIts brittle whispering, a prelude.\nSunbeams prickle like sudden warmth,\nSeeping through like shy fingers, seeking skin.\n\nThe air hums with the promise unmade,\nNot in words but in breaths that catch and falter.\nIn pockets, gloves crinkle against the cold,\nThen release to the softness of melting ice\u2014\nSnap, pop, a thousand tiny rebirths.\n\nInside, hearts thaw like hidden streams,\nTheir murmurs rising, slow and hesitant.\nHands tremble as old locks give way\u2014  \nThe click unlocks new chambers, secrets stirred.",
      "critique": "What's alive:\n- The sensory experiences of returning from winter, particularly the tactile elements like \"frost cracks underfoot\" and \"gloves crinkle against the cold.\"\n- The metaphorical use of \"sunbeams prickle like sudden warmth,\" which effectively conveys a physical sensation.\n- The internal emotional journey with lines like \"Hearts thaw like hidden streams.\"\n\nWhat isn't working:\n1. **Abstraction in Emotional Expression**: Lines such as \"The air hums with the promise unmade\" and \"Inside, hearts thaw like hidden streams\" are somewhat abstract and could benefit from more concrete imagery or direct sensory details.\n2. **Weak Line Breaks**: The line break after \"Not in words but in breaths that catch and falter\" disrupts the flow of the poem and doesn't enhance the meaning as much as it could.\n\nDirections:\n- Replace abstract phrases with more specific, sensory details. For example, instead of \"The air hums with the promise unmade,\" consider something like \"The air whispers with the scent of budding leaves.\"\n- Strengthen line breaks to improve rhythm and emphasis. Consider placing a break after \"then release\" in the fourth stanza: \"Then release / to the softness of melting ice\u2014\"\n\nWhen done, this poem has found its shape.",
