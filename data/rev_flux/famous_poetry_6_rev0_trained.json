  "final_poem": "# Hear America Singing\n\nHear the truck driver humming near the median,\nfinger pressing circles on the steering column's chrome,\nsinging a tune he learned in Texas\nwith his window cracked so the wind could carry it.\n\nHear the nurse at four AM, chart in hand,\nwhispering to her shift: *I'm here. I'm here again.*\nHer shoes click hollow down the linoleum,\neach step a verse she writes on patient floors.\n\nHear the nail technician in South Florida\nchatting with a customer about Netflix\u2014\nher hands work faster than any mouth,\npainting cuticles into rainbows nobody will see.\n\nHear the border patrol agent eating lunch\nin his unmarked sedan, watching nothing,\nholding a sandwich that tastes like duty\ntastes like every day he doesn't have to name.\n\nHear the student with two jobs, studying\nbetween shifts at the pharmacy counter\u2014\nher textbook open to page three hundred and fourteen,\nthe lullaby of fluorescent lights underneath her finger tips.\n\nEach one singing what comes easy: *I'm here.*\nThe layout technician in Memphis sends files off-peak,\nfingers dancing over keys that press against his sternum like old friends.\nHe sings in the quiet between transmissions, no one tuning in but him.\n\nHear them all\u2014ten thousand humming bees\nat different pitches, different volumes, different octaves of staying.\nThey don't know their songs overlap. They don't need to.\nThe way you hear a chord when you're singing alone\nand only later realize the whole room was already full.",
