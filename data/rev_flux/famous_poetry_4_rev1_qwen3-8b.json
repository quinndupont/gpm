      "critique": "**What's alive:**  \nThe poem successfully frames death as a mechanical failure (valve, piston, rusted coil) and sleep as a recalibration (\"reset of the machine\"). Enjambment stretches tension between defiance (\"I wind the clock\u2019s gears, defy the stall\") and inevitability (\"the oil in my veins thickens\").
