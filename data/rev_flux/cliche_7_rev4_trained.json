We wore out the heel\nof several conversations, turned them over,\nbit by bit the rubber came away from the canvas sole,\nand we carried on with just the stitched-on shape\nof what it was supposed to be.\n\nYou inherited my shoes. Not literally\u2014\nI'd have sent them back if you'd asked\u2014but\nthe ones I wore past the point where leather cracks\nalong the seam and won't heal.\nThe kind of damage that requires tacks,\nthat gets bashed inside a door frame every now and then\nand holds together anyway.\n\nYou wore them to a funeral. That's not why I mention it.\nIt's because you sat on my couch afterward,\nuntied them, ran your thumb across the stitched tongue,\nthe worn seam that kept coming back no matter how many times\nwe said *enough, throw them out*\u2014and then didn't.\n\nWe have those same tacks in every shelf unit we build together.\nNot nailed down. Handed loosed to whoever stumbles over them,\nbecause nobody's finished being clumsy by thirty-five.\n\nYou'll notice the shoe has no tongue.\nYou'll step on it occasionally. We both will.\nAnd that's how it is with most things\nwe keep after they stop being new\u2014\nnot because we value the object, exactly,\nbut because we've worn our gratitude into the leather\nand can't imagine discarding what holds the shape\nof every hallway we've walked through silence.\n\nThere's a crack along the side now, near the heel.\nYou'll feel it before you see it. That's how this works\u2014\nthe body ahead of the eye,\nremembering damage before memory does.\nWe won't fix it.

      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe central conceit \u2014 friendship as a shoe worn to the point of uselessness, kept not for warmth but for the habit of carrying weight \u2014 is genuinely strong and earns its space. The crack near the heel (line 29) is the poem's single most alive image: it does real sensory work before the reader has been told what to feel about it. That instinct should govern more of the piece.\n\nThe line \"We both will\" \u2014 where \"we\" splits between speaker and addressee mid-phrase \u2014 is a sharp structural move that avoids direct address clich\u00e9 while enacting the shared experience the poem describes. It's doing something interesting with syntax before it knows it.\n\nThe tacks in shelf units (lines 34\u201336) are concrete, quiet, and well-placed as an image of unfinished repair. That detail belongs to this poem and no other.\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Abstraction bloat \u2014 lines 5\u201310 especially.** \"Not because I needed watching / but because you were patient in a way \u2014 / the kind of habit no one calls a virtue.\" This is the poem explaining its own metaphor to itself. The ellipsis and dash already signal vagueness; then it says *more* about what patience looks like that dilutes the shoe image. **Direction:** Cut or compress this passage entirely. Let the left shoe without a tongue do the work of establishing observation. Trust the object.\n\n**Clich\u00e9 proximity \u2014 lines 13\u201316.** \"Turned them over, / bit by bit the rubber came away from the canvas sole, / and we carried on with just the stitched-on shape\" reads like a catalog of worn-out things that could apply to anything. The stitching-on-shape line is almost decorative. **Direction:** Anchor this passage in one specific detail \u2014 what does the speaker actually see? A pebble caught in thread? A particular kind of wear that *only* shoes get?\n\n**Sentimentality / editorializing \u2014 lines 17\u201320.** \"You inherited my shoes\" and the explanation that follow (\"Not literally \u2014 / I'd have sent them back if you'd asked\") are the poem telling us what to think about gratitude rather than letting the objects carry that weight. The shoe is already doing this; the prose around it explains it away. **Direction:** Remove or radically compress these lines. Let the inheritance be implicit in the image of worn-out soles.\n\n**Redundancy \u2014 \"wear out\" / \"worn out\" (lines 8, 12).** Same phrase in adjacent lines. The poem is more efficient elsewhere; here it's repeating itself. **Direction:** Choose one and cut the other.\n\n**Weak line break \u2014 line 30.** \"We both will\" breaks on a weak syntactic beat.

What's Alive\n\nThe dent along the side near where the foot goes in (line 29) \u2014 \"You'll feel it before you see it\" \u2014 is the poem's single most alive moment. That image earns everything around it: sensory, emotional, and structurally precise.\n\nThe line \"We keep putting our weight on it / and it keeps holding us\" has genuine force as a refrain.

What Isn't Working\n\n**Redundancy \u2014 \"keep you from falling down again and again.\"** The refrain says this twice (lines 41\u201343), and both instances are nearly identical. Direction: Make the second instance different \u2014 change what's being repeated, or cut one entirely.\n\n**Line 25 \u2014 \"itsastretcher\"** is a typo that reads as intentional fragmentation but doesn't land because it's uncontrolled. Fix it. If this was deliberate compression of \"stretcher,\" do something more legible first and let the line break create the compression.\n\n**Lines 17\u201320 (the inherited/shoes explanation).** The prose passage explains what the objects already dramatize. \"Not literally\" is the poem telling us not to be too literal, which is redundant with the image. Direction: Cut entirely or replace with one concrete detail \u2014 who touched this shoe last before you got it? What did that hand do?\n\n**Line 37 \u2014 \"its worn circumference.\"** The adjective \"worn\" appears twice in three lines (lines 36\u201338). Direction: Choose one.\n\n**Line 24 \u2014 \"rust stripe on I-4.\"** This is a scene detail, but it's generic highway language. If this matters, make it specific: what kind of rust?

Cut the final six lines entirely \u2014 \"itsastretcher\" typo aside, the repetition flattens the ending and the closing simile (\"keep you from falling down\") moves away from the object toward sentiment.\n\nRebuild the ending with something closer to the dent image: what does the shoe do at its breaking point?
