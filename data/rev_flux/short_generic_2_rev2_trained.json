Something underneath the skin\nhas softened like an animal that woke early,\nstretched, and found the den empty.\n\nThe clover knows her better than she knows herself.\nIt has been opening its mouth all winter,\na small throat full of honey and expectation,\nand when she kneels it smells like something\nshe was, some months ago, before the body\nbent this way, before it began to learn\nthe architecture of its own architecture.\n\nA weed pushes through the concrete of her heel.\nIt has no use for cement. It just keeps\nbeing what it kept being under rubble,\nwhat grows with such conviction that you have to\nlook twice to see if the ground is still there.\n\nShe does not know what she's reaching for.\nHer fingers keep unclenching as if\nsomeone were tying them open with ribbon \u2014\nnot a gift, just the ordinary work of hands\nthat haven't decided yet whether they are\nopening things or untying them,\nwhether this warmth is an invitation\nor a fever pitch, whether to press her palm\nagainst the cold stone and count it\nas ice or as the first suggestion\nof whatever comes after cold.",
      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe weed pushing through the concrete of her heel \u2014 that is the poem's strongest moment. It earns its place by being specific, tactile, and surprising in scale (a weed against a human heel). The image does real work: it reframes the whole conceit from landscape-as-body into body-as-landscape-within-a-body.\n\nThe line \"It has been opening its mouth all winter\" is also alive \u2014 the verb choice makes the clover do something unexpected. And \"the architecture of its own architecture\" in line 15 has genuine compression, even if it's slightly overloaded with meaning.\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Abstraction (lines 3\u20134):**\n\"She walks the fields and the grass recognizes her\nas something that happened yesterday, or tomorrow,\nsomething the body has already forgotten\nwhile the body is still performing.\"\nThis is the poem explaining its own conceit to us rather than embodying it. \"Happened yesterday, or tomorrow\" \u2014 this is vagueness dressed as ambiguity. The reader can't land on anything concrete because everything is a vague gesture toward strangeness.\n\n**Direction:** Cut or radically compress lines 3\u20134. Let the image of hands finding temperature (line 7) do the work that four lines of abstraction were trying to accomplish.\n\n---\n\n**\"Something underneath the skin / has softened like an animal that woke early, / stretched, and found the den empty.\"**\n\nThis is strong \u2014 visceral, particularized, earned by its context. It's also the poem's best moment of fragmentation (the enjambment across \"softened / like,\" which actually *does* work syntactically). The rest of the draft needs to catch up on that level of control.\n\n---\n\n**\"A weed pushes through the concrete of her heel.\"**\n\nThe metaphor collapses under its own weight. A weed pushing through concrete is a clich\u00e9 \u2014 it's dead language. \"Concrete\" here does nothing; it's there for the rhyme with \"heel.\" The image earns nothing from the reader because no sensory detail has been committed to it.\n\n**Direction:** Drop \"concrete\" entirely, or replace it with something that actually *is* concrete in texture and meaning \u2014 a hard surface, pavement, stone. Let the weed pushing through something solid be enough without naming what the noun is.\n\n---\n\n**\"She does not know what she's reaching for.\"**\n\nThis line announces its own ambiguity rather than enacting it. It tells the reader \"there's mystery here,\" which undermines whatever follows unless that following material is genuinely compelling.\n\n**Direction:** Replace with a concrete gesture \u2014 what *is* she reaching for? A stone, fire, ice? The poem needs to show the hand in action before naming confusion.\n\n---\n\n**\"Whether this warmth is an invitation / or a fever pitch\"**\n\nTwo abstract nouns doing the work that one fragmented image should",
