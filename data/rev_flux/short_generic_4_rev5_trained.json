      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe poem has a genuine engine in its attention to the skeleton as subject, and \"Marrow tastes of iron and the sea / of something that died inside a rock four billion years\" \u2014 that line earns its strangeness. The nested negations (\"What I'm describing / is before language. Is language\") also do real structural work, folding meaning inward.\n\nThe sequence beginning at \"Bent backward, vertebrae knock softly\" through the fish-skeleton simile has genuine physical specificity. \"Knock softly\" \u2014 that verb choice is precise and quiet; it earns its place more than most lines in this draft.\n\n\"Breath catches. Release. / Catch. Release.\" \u2014 this is the poem's strongest moment of form following content. The repetition enacts what it describes, and the shift from plural to singular (\"Release\") carries real weight without explanation.\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Clich\u00e9 and dead language (throughout):** \"Styrofoam of me,\" \"a pocket of air I can't reach,\" \"something that died inside a rock four billion years\" \u2014 these are the poet reaching for strangeness through metaphor that has already been worn smooth by popular culture. \"A pocket of air I can't reach\" in particular reads like a greeting card line. Direction: every image needs to be tested against the brief's bone-imagery domain. If it references water, flesh, or air in ways that don't map directly onto vertebral or marrow physics, cut or rebuild.\n\n**Abstraction and vagueness (lines 17\u201320):** \"A sound I made years ago crouching / in a freezer full of my own father's silence\" \u2014 this is the poem's weakest passage. Crouching in a freezer is a scene; it has sensory detail, but \"father's silence\" is pure abstraction. What silence? What did the room smell like? What sound did *that* line make? The seal comparison immediately after doesn't rescue it because both lines are still evasive.\n\n**Redundancy / structural collapse (lines 15\u201320):** The freezer passage, \"a pocket of air,\" and the fish-skeleton simile all occupy roughly the same emotional space \u2014 trapped memory, breathlessness \u2014 without advancing the poem. The fish skeleton simile is genuinely good but arrives after three lines that dilute it.\n\n**Line breaks (throughout):** Many breaks feel arbitrary rather than purposeful. \"Marrow softens / like something left out too long\" \u2014 \"too long\" is doing nothing interesting; cut it and let the line break do its own work. \"The jaw locks open / and won't\" \u2014 this line break creates a false pause that doesn't earn tension, especially next to the stronger \"Breath catches.\" Direction: read each line as an independent unit of breath control.",

      "critique": "## Revision Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe poem has found its shape.\n\n\"Vertebrae stack\nagainst each other warm\"\n\nThis opening earns its compression \u2014 the plural \"stack\" does more work than almost any line in this draft, and \"warm\" sets a physical temperature without naming it as such.\n\n\"Bent backward, vertebrae knock softly\nlike bones on a table\"\n\nThe fish-skeleton simile survives because it arrives late enough to land. More importantly, the verb \"knock softly\" is precise \u2014 quiet, specific, sensory.\n\n\"What I'm describing\nis before language. Is language\"\n\nThe nested negations do structural work. The poem knows this is about the edge of meaning and never retreats from that awareness.\n\n\"Breath catches. Release.\nCatch. Release.\"\n\nThis passage enacts what it describes with real rhythmic authority. The shift from plural to singular (\"Release\") is genuinely felt, not explained.\n\n\"Marrow tastes of iron and saltwater\nof something that died inside basalt four billion years ago\"\n\nThe layered mineral taste \u2014 the three registers there (iron, sea, deep time) \u2014 are earned through accumulation. This is the poem's strongest image by a wide margin.\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Redundancy / structural collapse (lines 17\u201320):** The freezer passage (\"crouching in a freezer full of my own father's silence\"), \"a pocket of air I can't reach,\" and the fish-skeleton simile all occupy roughly the same emotional space \u2014 trapped memory, breathlessness \u2014 without advancing the poem. **Direction:** Choose one.

What silence? **Direction:** Replace with sensory detail. The line needs at least one thing the room physically held.\n\n**Redundant and vague language (line 14):** \"and there is pressure on the diaphragm\nbut I have to breathe\" \u2014 redundant, and the \"but I have to breathe\" deflates the tension. **Direction:** Cut or replace with a physical consequence of that pressure.\n\n**Arbitrary line breaks (throughout):** Many breaks create false pauses that don't serve the poem's breath-control logic. \"Marrow softens / like something left out too long\" \u2014 \"too long\" is filler; cut it. \"The jaw locks open\nand won't\" \u2014 the break here creates a pause that weakens rather than intensifies. **Direction:** Read each line as an independent unit of breath control. If the break doesn't create a meaningful inhalation or exhalation, reposition or remove.\n\n**Clich\u00e9 (line 12):**",
