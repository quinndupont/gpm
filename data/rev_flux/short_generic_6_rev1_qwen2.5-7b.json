      "draft": "In circuits etched by silicon dreams,\nData streams like rivers under bridges,\nWhere holograms of galaxies bloom,\nAnd faces in virtual symphonies sing.\n\nArtificial minds, their patterns weave,\nThrough neural nets where thoughts intertwine\u2014\nA cityscape mirrored on a screen,\nEach pixel flickering with human sign.\n\nRobots converse with a gentle voice,\nIn homes that learn and adapt each day.\nYet shadows linger 'neath the digital skies,\nAs data hoards in cold servers lay.\n\nAugmented reality overlays truth,\nOn glass panes etched by light's soft touch.\nBut who decides what light should filter through?\nThe algorithms whisper, \"Your world must suit.\"\n\nQuantum leaps across the cosmic web,\nWhere satellites dance with starlight's beat.\nYet in this realm of boundless possibility,\nLies the seed of uncertainty.\n\nFor every byte that flies and falls,\nEchoes doubts about our choices small.\nIn codes both simple, complex, bright,\nWe grapple still with human right.",
      "critique": "What works:\n- The opening lines effectively set a futuristic tone, using vivid imagery like \"circuit,\" \"silicon dreams,\" and \"holograms of galaxies\" to establish the technological landscape.\n- The contrast between the bright, optimistic aspects of technology (like \"gentle voice,\" \"learn and adapt\") and the darker implications (\"shadows linger,\" \"data hoards in cold servers lay\") creates a compelling tension.\n\nWhat isn't working:\n- **Abstraction**: Lines like \"Artificial minds, their patterns weave\" and \"A cityscape mirrored on a screen\" are abstract and could benefit from more concrete examples or metaphors.\n- **Weak line breaks**: The line breaks sometimes disrupt the flow of ideas. For example, breaking \"Where holograms of galaxies bloom,\" into two lines weakens its impact.\n\nDirections:\n- Replace abstract terms with specific technological elements. For instance, instead of \"Artificial minds, their patterns weave,\" consider something like \"Neural networks that learn and grow.\"\n- Strengthen line breaks to enhance the rhythm and emphasis. Consider combining or splitting lines to better convey the intended imagery and emotion. For example, try: \n  - \"Where holograms of galaxies bloom\" on one line\n  - \"And faces in virtual symphonies sing\" on another\n\nWhen done, this poem has found its shape.",
