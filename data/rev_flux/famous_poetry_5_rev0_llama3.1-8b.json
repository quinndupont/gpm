  "final_poem": "A fleeting form, a shadow cast\nDown the path, where footsteps last\nUnmindful of eyes that watch and wait\nIt searches for crumbs to seal its fate\n\nIts feathers fluffed, it pecks with care\nAt scattered seeds that lie in air\n Oblivious to all but its delight\nIn sifting through the morning's light\n\nThe world recedes as its focus tightens\nOn every morsel, every enticing scent\nIt forages on, lost in its own thoughts\nA tiny king, in its domain brought\n\nAnd when it's finished, and has eaten well\nIt vanishes from sight, a fleeting spell.",
