      "draft": "In the shadowed room where whispers dwell,\nA feathered figure brushed my cheek.\nIts touch, as soft as memories tell,\nOf hands that held but do not speak.\n\nI wondered then if I had felt a thing\u2014\nOr merely thought it so?\nFor in its gaze, no answer clung:\nJust blankness, empty and slow.\n\nYet still the raven leaned close to me,\nWith eyes that seemed to hold some tale.\nI tried to grasp what could be said,\nBut only silence filled the trail.\n\nEach moment stretched like hours on end\u2014\nThe scratch of breath against my throat.\nIn these confines where I\u2019m confined,\nHow did I come here, alone?\n\nWas it but a dream this all began?\nOr is existence simply dust?\nFor in that presence, lost and small,\nNo sign remains but haunting musts.",
      "critique": "What works:\n- The draft effectively uses sensory details to create a haunting atmosphere, particularly in lines like \"A feathered figure brushed my cheek\" and \"The scratch of breath against my throat.\"\n- The internal monologue provides insight into the speaker's psychological state, making the presence of the raven more impactful.\n\nIssues:\n- **Weak Line Breaks**: Lines such as \"For in its gaze, no answer clung:\" and \"But only silence filled the trail.\" could benefit from repositioning to enhance the rhythm and pacing.\n- **Overly Abstract Phrasing**: Phrases like \"whispers dwell\" and \"existence simply dust\" are abstract and may detract from the poem's clarity. Consider more concrete imagery or direct statements.\n\nDirections:\n- Reconsider line breaks in lines 5, 8, and 13 to better emphasize pauses and transitions.\n- Replace abstract phrases with more vivid sensory details. For example, change \"whispers dwell\" to something like \"shadows whisper secrets.\"\n- Ensure the internal monologue remains clear and direct without sacrificing poetic quality.\n\nWhen these adjustments are made, this poem has found its shape.",
