      "critique": "### What Works:\n- The imagery of \"crisscrossed lines\" and \"map of shared laughter's gentle curves\" effectively sets a visual and emotional tone.\n- Vivid descriptions like \"whispers blend into clear views\" and \"storms raged fierce as time passed right\" add depth to the couple\u2019s journey.\n- The recurring theme of daily trials and shared experiences is well-developed, highlighting the strength of their bond.\n\n### Issues:\n1. **Rhyme Scheme:**\n   - **Line 4:** \"views\" does not rhyme with \"met.\" Consider replacing \"views\" with a word like \"sights.\"\n   - **Line 6:** \"new\" does not rhyme with \"curves.\" Replace \"new\" with \"lovers,\" which also fits the context.\n   - **Line 9:** \"stark\" does not rhyme with \"met.\" Use \"part\" instead, maintaining the theme of separation and connection.\n   - **Line 10:** \"dreams\" does not rhyme with \"curves.\" Replace it with \"streams.\"\n   - **Line 12:** \"streams\" is already used in line 10. Consider a different word like \"tears.\"\n   - **Line 13:** \"glance\u2014\" does not rhyme with \"met.\" Use \"stance\" to maintain the rhyme scheme.\n   - **Line 15:** \"learned\" does not rhyme with \"curves.\" Replace it with \"danced,\" which also fits the theme of their shared experiences.\n\n2. **Meter:**\n   - The poem generally follows a consistent iambic pattern, but some lines deviate slightly. For example:\n     - Line 1 has three pyrrhics instead of iambs.\n     - Line 2 has a trochee in foot 3.\n   - Consider maintaining the iambic pentameter to enhance the rhythmic flow.\n\n### Directions:\n- **Rhyme Scheme:** Revise lines 4, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, and 17 to fit the ABA pattern. Use words like \"sights,\" \"lovers,\" \"part,\" \"tears,\" \"stance,\" and \"danced.\"\n- **Meter:** Ensure each line has five iambs (unstressed-stressed) by adjusting word choices or adding/removing syllables where necessary.\n- **Imagery:** Strengthen the imagery in lines 18 and 19 to reflect the couple\u2019s enduring bond. Consider using more specific and evocative words.\n\n### Revised Draft:\n---\nIn the crisscrossed lines where they met,\nA map of shared laughter's gentle curves.\nEach other\u2019s stories woven tight,\nWhere whispers blend into clear sights.\n\nThrough winters cold, through summers bright,\nThey danced on paths both known and new.\nThe storms raged fierce as time passed right,\nYet held by hands",
