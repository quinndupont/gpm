      "critique": "**What's alive:**  \nThe opening lines (\"The stars collapse into ash...\") establish celestial decay with visceral imagery. The fault line metaphor effectively contrasts impermanence and permanence. The coral cathedral and tectonic plates imagery align with the geological domain, creating a cohesive tension between erosion and endurance. The closing lines (\"we will keep moving...\") tie the metaphors to a universal, almost mythic persistence.  \n\n**What isn't working:**  \n- **Abstraction**: \"Love is the fault line\u2014\" feels didactic; the metaphor is strong but the line risks flattening the complexity of geological processes.  \n- **Weak line break**: \"still shifting, still bleeding / hot, ancient rock\" lacks momentum; the break between \"bleeding\" and \"hot\" disrupts the flow.  \n-",
