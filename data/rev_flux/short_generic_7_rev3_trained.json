      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### What's Alive\n\nThe third section \u2014 \"Wax moves slow / across the drumhead of ear / heating the skin\" \u2014 is the strongest single image in the poem. It earns its place by doing concrete physical work: wax as something that spreads, a membrane, heat transferred to flesh. The verb choices are precise and tactile.\n\n\"Gulp. Gulp.\" opening the poem with sound before silence arrives has genuine structural logic \u2014 we feel the compression from breath before it leaves.\n\n\"Breath fogs glass / and inside that circle / a kind of ocean\" lands because it's the most grounded image in terms of temperature, surface, and scale simultaneously. The fog on glass is real; the interior becomes an ocean only after the reader has lived through the cold.\n\n### What Isn't Working\n\n**Abstraction bailing on concreteness (lines 9\u201312):**\n\"disappears the bones of language / just hums now\"\nThis is where the poem abandons its own method. After three sustained, specific physical images, the final gesture reaches for summary and abstraction: \"bones,\" \"language,\" \"just hums.\" These are *toward* silence but not *in* silence. The word \"now\" in particular gestures toward narration \u2014 it tells us what happened rather than letting the last image hold weight on its own.\n\n**Direction:** Cut or radically compress lines 9\u201312 to one line, and make that line as concrete as the earwax image. If silence must be named, name a physical fact about silence, not an emotional label.\n\n**Clich\u00e9: \"just hums now\"**\nEven if revised, this phrase leans on the word \"hum\" doing too much \u2014 it sounds like a greeting card version of vibration. The earlier vertebrae-fountain image already does that work better.\n\n**Direction:** Replace with something as physical as \"heating the skin.\"\n\n**Weak closure: Lines 13\u201314**\nThe poem closes on a summary pronoun (\"What was here\") without grounding it in any image or action. It opens with sound, moves through body-landscape, and closes with a question that deflates rather than deepens.\n\n**Direction:** End with one final, unexplained physical detail \u2014 let the silence *do* something visible at the edge of perception. The poem earns its ending by staying inside the material world; it just needs to stay there fully.\n\nThe draft is close. It has found several shapes. The revision direction: sharpen lines 9\u201312 into one line of equal concreteness, and let the closing land on a physical fact rather than a question.\n---\n\nThis poem has found its shape.",
