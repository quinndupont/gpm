The silence carries\nwhat carrying means: weight without noise.\n\nHis breath comes back to him like a small\ncracked bell. He holds it against his lip\nand lets the cold take it. It does.\nHe watches the oval it left in the air\nvanish, too \u2014 which is what all his keeping\namounts to: the thing you leave behind\nso clean no one will ask you about it later.\n\nAnd still he walks the way someone might walk\na boundary they're responsible for,\nmarking every dead bush, every lean\nin the fence line. Not because a word was said.\nNot because anything. Just the long slow\neffort of not letting the woods\nbecome entirely theirs.",

What's Alive\n\nThe closing conceit \u2014 that the man walks a boundary he is responsible for, marking dead bushes and fence leanings *without* any named obligation \u2014 is the poem's strongest move. The final line (\"Just the long slow / effort of not letting the woods / become entirely theirs.\") earns its weight because it resists explaining itself. It trusts the reader to feel the paradox: care without reason.\n\nThe wheel-ruts passage (lines 19\u201323) also works well. The image does specific physical and emotional work \u2014 each rut is a question answered *too many times*, which conveys repetition as both habit and compulsion. \"Keeps their own cold discipline\" gives the snow-packed ruts an appropriate hardness.\n\nThe frost-on-glass section (lines 5\u20137) has real compression: \"chalk-white,\" \"uncanny in their quiet.\" That adjective does something unexpected for its thickness.\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Sentimentality / earned vs. unearned emotion.** The poem earns some of its feeling through concrete imagery (the cracked bell of breath, the vanishing oval). But other moments reach toward sentiment without earning it:\n\n- **\"The phrase sits sideways in his mouth like a bone.\"** This is a dead metaphor \u2014 a phrase *sitting* like a bone. It doesn't land physically. Direction: either make this image sharper and more specific to what that unspoken thing feels like in the body, or cut it entirely.\n  \n- **\"weight without noise\" (line 26).** A tautology dressed as profundity. The preceding line already establishes silence; \"no sound\" is redundant there too (\"The woods between him and home have gone dead / as something that was planted too early\"). Direction: compress these two lines into one image that does both jobs.\n  \n- **\"It [his breath] comes back to him\" (line 21).** This reads like a fill-in, not an observed detail. Breath returning is automatic; the poem needs to be *in* that moment rather than reporting on it.\n\n**Clich\u00e9 proximity.** A few lines hover near stock language without quite crossing:\n\n- **\"the woods between him and home\" (line 16).** This is a clich\u00e9 waiting to happen. Direction: name the actual road or path. \"Between him and home\" is vague; what does he *cross*?\n  \n- **\"each one is a question he has answered / hundreds of times\" (lines 20\u201321).** The abstraction \"hundreds of times\" deflates the specificity the wheel-ruts earned earlier. Direction: stay with the image or make it more precise \u2014 what does he actually see in each rut?\n  \n- **\"what carrying means: weight without noise.\"** This explanation tells rather than shows.
