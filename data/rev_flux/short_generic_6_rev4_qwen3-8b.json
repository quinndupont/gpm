A smoother transition (e.g., a shared image or internal logic) would maintain the poem\u2019s fragmented rhythm.  \n- **Sentimentality**: The closing line\u2019s phrasing (\u201cTime erodes not by taking, but by letting go\u201d) leans toward moralizing, which softens the poem\u2019s focus on tangible decay.  \n\n**Direction**:  \nReframe the final line to align with the poem\u2019s concrete imagery. Instead of a philosophical statement, tie the conclusion to a specific, decaying object (e.g., a fractured gear, a fading scent). For the line break issue, consider linking \u201cdust\u201d to the hour hand via a shared sensory detail (e.g., \u201cdust / where the hour hand stalls\u201d).  \n\nThis poem has found its shape.",
