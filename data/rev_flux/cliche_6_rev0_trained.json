  "final_poem": "Across the throb of dancers, across\nthe gauze of cigarette smoke,\nyour eyes found mine\u2014the way a river\ntracks its own course through rock,\n\nunflinching, certain. I had not turned.\nThe room was filled with other light:\nlaughter pressed against the walls,\na DJ's fader sliding left to right\n\nlike something leaving. Only you\nwere fixed on me as if I were\nthe frequency that tuned your equipment.\nOnly you were pressing in.\n\nAnd when our gazes locked\u2014I mean\nit the way a camera locks\u2014\nthere was no shutter, no mechanics,\njust two apertures wide open\n\non each other's world. The darkroom\nof my chest already developing\nyour contour at the edge of things I held\nbeneath the bright bulb, trying to see\n\nwhat develop means. You didn't smile.\nYou didn't signal. You stood\nin your black jacket, beer whey\naround your mouth like something written.\n\nBut your eyes\u2014your eyes had already\nexposed my interest, developed it\nto the grain of I can't look away,\ncan't look away, and the film\n\nwent tight with emotion the way\nphotographic emulsion does when\nit meets the thing it was exposed to.\nI didn't know what I was feeling.\n\nYou didn't either. We kept dancing.\nThe floor was tilting now, or so it seemed\u2014\nno one else off balance, just us,\nthe room emptying of everyone\n\nbut the image that had already\nreversed itself, the negative\nstanding in for what we started\ncalling real, calling true,\n\nstuck on the developing tray\nbetween darkness and the bright bulb,\nboth exposed at once: my heart\nsplit open like a reservoir\n\nletting water back in. Everything\nI didn't know I wanted\nsat there in your eyes\u2014\nthe way an emulsion holds\n\nits latent image before\nit captures anything, before\nthe current does its work,\nbefore the print comes off the tray\n\nand you can finally see\nwhat was always already there.",
