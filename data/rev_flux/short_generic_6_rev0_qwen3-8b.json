  "final_poem": "Time is a river, relentless and wide,  \nIts current carries moments, untraced,  \nA sandhill of seconds, slipping from sight,  \nEach grain a memory, each ripple a trace.  \n\nThe clock\u2019s breath hums through the hollowed hours,  \nA pendulum\u2019s sigh, a metronome\u2019s ache,  \nIt stitches the dawn to the dusk\u2019s slow doors,  \nAnd folds the future into yesterday\u2019s wake.  \n\nWe chase the horizon, yet it slips away\u2014  \nA shadow that stretches, then fades to blue.  \nThe stars, ancient witnesses, blink and decay,  \nWhile years bloom like flowers, then wither to dew.  \n\nIn every heartbeat, the past begins to rise,  \nA whisper of yesterday, a echo of rain.  \nTime does not pause for the soul\u2019s quiet cries,  \nBut weaves our sorrows into its endless chain.  \n\nSo let us drink deep from the stream\u2019s cold song,  \nFor time is both thief and the keeper of light\u2014  \nA dance of the fleeting, the endless, the strong,  \nA moment that cradles the infinite night.",
