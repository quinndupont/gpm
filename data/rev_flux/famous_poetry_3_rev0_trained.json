The engine ticks its small\nacknowledgment of road and ratchet.\nSnow settles on the hood like memory\non a surface meant for other things.\n\nThere is a house behind this stand,\nthough only framework and smoke-sheathed walls\u2014\na kind of promise drawn in steam,\nthe kind that vanishes with what it shows.\n\nI have kept so many promises to walk\nno further, to let darkness hold me here\nwith its thick wool coat and no-guests sign.\nThe woods are safe. The snow is mine\n\nto study, each crystal laid against\nthe backwind window of my thinking\u2014\nsix arms extended, turning toward the light,\neach one a vow I once made not to fear.\n\nAnd still I do not move. The engine\nquiets now, its breath released\ninto the cold as something finally\nsatisfied with the way things are.\n\nI will not tell myself the morning comes.\nI will not promise that. For some promises\nare not about the arrival\u2014sweet house,\nopen door\u2014are more the turning homeward,\n\nthe careful packing of one's eyes\nfrom dark, the slow unstrapping\nof a coat whose sleeves were never meant\nto hold the weight of anywhere else.",
