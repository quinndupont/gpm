  "final_poem": "In the hollow of night, where shadows creep,  \nA raven alights on the windowsill's keep.  \nIts eyes like smoldering coals, it peers  \nAt the man who sits, his heart in tears.  \n\n\"Never,\" it croons, with a voice so low,  \nEach syllable a dagger, each note a blow.  \nThe man, already broken, feels the weight,  \nOf words that echo through the chamber's gate.  \n\n\"Never,\" again, as if to mock his pain,  \nThe raven's cry cuts through the silence, vain.  \nThe man, in his sorrow, can't escape,  \nThe relentless echo of that heavy shape.  \n\nAnd still it sits, a dark, unyielding guide,  \nA reminder of loss, a shadow in the tide.  \n\"Never,\" it says, as dawn begins to break,  \nA word that binds the grieving man's fate.",
