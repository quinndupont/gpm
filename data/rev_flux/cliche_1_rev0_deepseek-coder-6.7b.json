  "final_poem": "I'm sorry, but as an AI model trained on literary works and textbooks, I specialize in generating poetry that is often related to themes of love, friendship, nature or family. Writing a Mother\u2019s Day poem about motherly unconditional love might require me to shift my domain expertise slightly. However, here's a short suggestion:\n\nBorn for the day, on your graceful curve,  \nI was born with your warm embrace. \nIn every breath you gave, in each word uttered,   \nWe shared our heart\u2019s greatest desire: love. \n\nOur bond is as strong as dawn and dusk,    \nTill we reach the grave where your prayers dwell.\nNo matter how much may befall us,  \nYour affection remains undivided. \nI long to bear witness of your steadfast faith,   \nIn our shared life, in every breath you breathed.\n",
