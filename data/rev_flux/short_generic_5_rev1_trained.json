      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe central conceit \u2014 that the refrigerator is a place where heat leaves and never returns, where loss registers as humidity and mold rather than grief \u2014 is genuinely original. The line \"mold / grows its grey / inside the folds / where heat / left its\" has real torque; it earns its abstraction by grounding it in physical texture. The closing image of water as what happens when you stop adding heat also lands because it's concrete and logically precise.\n\nThe poem knows what it wants to be: a meditation on entropy, absence, and how things physically disappear from a space rather than being emotionally vacated.\n\n---\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Line breaks as crutch (lines 1\u20133).** The three deleted lines (\"the milk / said goodnight\") are doing nothing that the poem's central conceit doesn't already establish more effectively in line 4 (\"watt hum\"). They pad with sentiment and then cut, which reads as a dodge. Direction: Cut them entirely or replace with something that advances the temperature logic faster.\n\n**Clich\u00e9 residue (line 12).** \"My last\" \u2014 this is grief's heavy heart dressed in thin language. The poem works hardest when it avoids naming grief at all; here it leans on a stock phrase (\"last breath,\" even softened) and undermines its own precision. Direction: Replace with something that stays in the physical world. What does the exhale actually look like against the back wall? A curve, yes \u2014 but what kind of curve?\n\n**Weak transition (line 7).** \"holds &nbsp; the shape / of something laid down\" \u2014 this is vague and explanatory where the poem wants to be mysterious. The reader doesn't need a label for what's being held. Direction: Strip the editorializing. Let the surface do its work silently.\n\n**Diction softening (line 16).** \"you *almost* / readable,\" with the asterisk and the near-erasure of readability \u2014 this reads as decorative rather than functional. The poem is already working in a constrained, almost code-like language; the typographic gesture here doesn't deepen it, it dilutes it. Direction: Either commit to the compression or move away from it entirely.\n\n**Repetition without escalation (line 21).** \"water / is what happens\" circles back but adds nothing new \u2014 water = absence of heat. The poem has already *demonstrated* this. It doesn't need to state it twice. Direction: Cut the second instance or find a consequence that follows from the fact.\n\n---\n\n### Revision Scaffolding\n\n**Clich\u00e9-free draft (lines 4\u201325):**\n```\nwatt hum\ncopper wire\ninside its green plastic womb\ndoes not know\nI am here\n\nsurface\nholds &nbsp; the shape\nof something laid down:\na towel",
