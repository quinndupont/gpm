      "draft": "In the drawer's embrace, an old photograph clings,\nWhispering secrets through creased leather bindings.\nA faded handkerchief, once soft as dreams untold,\nNow brittle under touch, its fibers worn and cold.\n\nThe scent of pipe smoke lingers in the air,\nAn invisible cloud from a face long gone somewhere.\nA glass bottle, its edges chipped by time\u2019s relentless hum,\nReflects shards of light that dance like distant sun.\n\nIn the attic's shadowed corner stands an old chair\u2014\nIts wood creaking tales no ear can hear anymore.\nThe ticking clock ticks on, but the hands forget their task,\nPausing in a moment when shadows danced and laughed in sparks.\n\nA cracked phonograph needle scratches silent grooves,\nTales of yesteryears that fade to hollow hoots.\nEach object tells its story, then refuses it\u2014\nLeaves whispers of what once was, now buried deep from sight.",
      "critique": "What works:\n- The tactile and sensory details are vivid, such as the \"brittle under touch\" of the handkerchief and the \"ticking clock ticks on, but the hands forget their task.\"\n- The uneven line breaks effectively mimic the fragmented nature of memory.\n\nIssues:\n1. **Clich\u00e9**: The phrase \"Whispering secrets through creased leather bindings\" is a clich\u00e9 that could be more original.\n2. **Weak Line Breaks**: Lines like \"A glass bottle, its edges chipped by time\u2019s relentless hum,\" and \"In the attic's shadowed corner stands an old chair\u2014\" could benefit from stronger breaks to enhance the fragmented feel of memory.\n\nDirections:\n- Replace \"Whispering secrets through creased leather bindings\" with something more unique, such as \"Leather-bound whispers in a drawer's embrace.\"\n- Consider breaking lines like \"A glass bottle, its edges chipped by time\u2019s relentless hum,\" into two shorter lines: \n  - \"A glass bottle, its edges chipped by time\u2019s relentless hum,\"\n  - \"Reflects shards of light that dance like distant sun.\"\n\nThis poem has found its shape.",
