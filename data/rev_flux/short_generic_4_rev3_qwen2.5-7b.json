      "draft": "Binary whispers in silence,\nOn vast hard drives they sleep.\nZeros, ones in endless dance,\nEchoes of digital deep.\n\nData streams through fiber optic,\nA net that never doth weep.\nBits flicker like distant stars,\nIn realms where time is steep.\n\nServers hum in cool embrace,\nWhere memories float and peep.\nThrough networks far and wide they traverse,\nYet none can touch or seep.",
      "critique": "What's alive:\n- The metaphor of memory as digital data is compelling and unique.\n- The imagery of \"servers hum in cool embrace\" evokes a sense of both warmth and coldness, which adds depth.\n\nIssues:\n- **Weak Line Breaks**: Lines 3 and 4 could be more effective if broken differently. Consider breaking after \"endless dance\" to emphasize the movement of zeros and ones.\n- **Overuse of Metaphor**: While metaphors are strong, there's a risk of overusing them which can make the poem feel repetitive. For example, \"Bits flicker like distant stars\" could be replaced with something more original.\n\nDirections:\n- Break line 4 after \"endless dance\": \"Zeros, ones in endless dance,\\nEchoes of digital deep.\"\n- Replace \"Bits flicker like distant stars,\" with: \"Bits shimmer in the void,\\nLike fleeting constellations.\"\n\nWhen done, this poem has found its shape.",
