      "draft": "In mornings, coffee brews while shadows stretch,\nA silent greeting where paws and hand meet.\nThe click of a leash on floorboards, soft\u2014\nWhispers of love in each shared look.\n\nEvening strolls down empty streets, the two,\nSide by side, the world's quiet too.\nNo words exchanged yet meaning fills the air,\nBeneath the sky where stars start to gather near.\n\nDays blend into nights in this unspoken dance,\nWhere comfort is found without a chance\nTo speak aloud of what's already known\u2014\nA silent bond where every gesture\u2019s shown.",
      "critique": "What works:\n- The imagery of morning and evening routines creates a sense of daily rhythm.\n- The unspoken bond between the pet and owner is effectively conveyed through subtle interactions.\n\nIssues:\n1. **Weak Line Breaks**: Lines like \"In mornings, coffee brews while shadows stretch,\" and \"Evening strolls down empty streets, the two,\" can benefit from more strategic placement to emphasize the quiet moments.\n2. **Sentimentality**: Phrases such as \"Whispers of love in each shared look\" and \"meaning fills the air\" are overly sentimental and could be refined for a more understated tone.\n\nDirections:\n- Consider breaking lines to highlight specific details, e.g., \"In mornings / coffee brews while shadows stretch.\"\n- Replace \"Whispers of love in each shared look\" with something like \"A fleeting glance, a silent touch,\" which maintains the unspoken bond without overt sentimentality.\n- For \"meaning fills the air,\" try \"the quiet speaks,\" to maintain the poem's subtle tone.\n\nWhen these adjustments are made, this poem has found its shape.",
