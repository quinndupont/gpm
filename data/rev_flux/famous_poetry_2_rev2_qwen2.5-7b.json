      "draft": "Autumn leaves scatter, crisp underfoot,\nA whispering wind, cold and sharp.\nThe raven perches, black as night's shadow,\nIts eyes like coals in a flickering lamp.\n\nBare branches tremble with his presence\u2014\nA chill that seeps through the man\u2019s soul.\nNo more silence fills this empty house,\nNow echo hushed calls that pierce the gloom.\n\nSpring blooms bloom and fade, a transient beauty,\nWhile he watches, frozen in thought.\nThe raven stays, an uninvited guest,\nInterrupting his quietude.\n\nSummer sun blazes high, but on his face\nOnly shadows linger, deepening night.\nA call from beyond, a mocking tone\u2014\n\u201cWhy dwell here? Why not leave this place?\u201d\n\nWinter comes, cold and biting, harshness \nFalling softly, muffled by silence.\nYet still he stays, as raven watches,\nIn the hush of snow, his presence felt.\n\nTime passes in these endless seasons,\nEach one a reminder, unasked for\u2014\nThat life moves on with or without him.",
      "critique": "What's alive:\n- The imagery of nature and the changing seasons effectively reflects the man\u2019s emotional journey.\n- The presence of the raven as an uninvited guest disrupts the solitude, creating a compelling contrast.\n\nIssues:\n- **Weak Line Breaks**: Some lines feel too long or could benefit from shorter breaks to enhance the rhythm and pacing. For example, \"A chill that seeps through the man\u2019s soul\" might be more impactful if broken into two lines: \"A chill / That seeps through the man's soul.\"\n- **Overuse of Repetition**: The phrase \"uninvited guest\" is repeated twice in close proximity, which can feel redundant. Consider varying it or removing one instance.\n- **Sentimentality**: There\u2019s a tendency to state emotions directly rather than showing them through imagery and action. For example, instead of saying \"frozen in thought,\" focus on the man's physical actions that convey his emotional state.\n\nDirections:\n1. **Refine Line Breaks**: Shorten lines where possible to create a more dynamic rhythm. For instance, break up long lines like: \n   - \"A chill that seeps through the man\u2019s soul.\"\n   - \"No more silence fills this empty house.\"\n\n2. **Vary Repetition**: Replace \"uninvited guest\" with another phrase in one of its occurrences to avoid redundancy.\n\n3. **Show, Don\u2019t Tell**: Use sensory details and actions to convey emotions rather than stating them directly. For example:\n   - Instead of \u201cfrozen in thought,\u201d describe his physical stillness: \n     - \u201cHis body remains motionless, a statue amidst the chaos.\u201d\n   - Instead of \"hush of snow,\" focus on how it affects him:\n     - \u201cIn the hush of snow, he feels more alone than ever.\u201d\n\nWhen done, this poem has found its shape.",
