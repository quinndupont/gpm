      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe poem has genuine structural intelligence. The domestic accumulation \u2014 coffee pilot light, dog barking at three, linoleum cold as discipline, the keychain click \u2014 builds a world that feels inhabited rather than decorated. The final image of him clicking the keychain: that is the poem's real subject. Everything else orbits it.\n\nThe line \"how they hold their single thing / the way a person holds a secret\" risks abstraction but earns its place because it arrives after the concrete images of left-handed cereal pouring and naming bowls after absent sleepers. The poem knows what it wants to say by that point, so the summary is allowed.\n\nThe enjambment is working hard \u2014 \"cuts through something he can stand to keep\" breaks across a line with genuine tension. \"Folds each bowl after someone slept through it\" earns its length because \"bowl\" does double duty (container and thing named for another person). These are specific choices, not decorative ones.\n\nThe dog barking at nothing gets the poem's attention \u2014 that's real perception, not stock imagery.\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Sentimentality / editorializing \u2014 lines 17\u201320:**\n> I have not woken. The linoleum\n> holds its cold like a kind of discipline \u2014\n> how you have to earn the room back,\n> folding sheets or pouring milk\n> into cereal with the left hand only,\n> naming each bowl after someone slept through it.\n>\n> His fingers find the keychain\n> without looking. Three rings of nothing.\n\nThe passage from \"I have not woken\" through \"slept through it\" is the poem explaining itself to the reader instead of letting the images do that work. \"Folding sheets or pouring milk / into cereal with the left hand only, / naming each bowl after someone slept through it\" \u2014 this is a list of things that could all appear in one image without editorial comment. The \"how you have to earn the room back\" line breaks the immersion for no payoff.\n\n**Direction:** Cut or radically compress lines 17\u201320. Let the images of pouring left-handed, naming bowls after absent people, and the keychain click stand as a single sequence. Trust the accumulation. If the poem needs one more image to arrive at its subject (the clicking), that's fine \u2014 but \"earning the room back\" is the poet narrating what should be visible.\n\n**Clich\u00e9 \u2014 line 10:**\n> and I watch his hand unfold\n> a newspaper no one folds anymore,\n\nThis reads like a clich\u00e9 of the pandemic era. It gestures at something without landing on anything particular. Is it actually *no one* or is it specific? The vagueness kills it.\n\n**Direction:** Make this concrete \u2014 what does he do with the paper beyond unfolding? What's in his hands while",

      "critique": "## Revision Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe final sequence is the strongest work in this revision:\n\n> His fingers find the keychain \u2014 three rings of nothing.\n> The coffee is getting warm now,\n> which means soon someone will drink from it.\n\nThis earns its place because everything preceding it has built the domestic world with enough precision that \"someone will drink\" lands as revelation. The click-to-thumb-click repetition, the worn keychain, the warmth \u2014 these are concrete and trusted.\n\nThe dog barking at three AM is alive: \"Some hare or fox on the property line / he'll never see.\" That \"never see\" does real perceptual work \u2014 it's precise in what it denies. The lawn mower line\n\n> that thin guttural thing that cuts\n> through someone else's yard like a blade\n> through something he can stand to keep.\n\nStill has some editorializing (\"guttural,\" \"thin\") that could be cut or replaced with a more specific sensory detail \u2014 the actual sound, not the feeling about the sound. The keychain click is the poem's subject arriving at last.\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Sentimentality / editorializing \u2014 lines 17\u201320 (cut entirely):**\n\n> I have not woken. The linoleum\n> holds its cold like a kind of discipline \u2014\n> how you have to earn the room back,\n> folding sheets or pouring milk\n> into cereal with the left hand only,\n> naming each bowl after someone slept through it.\n>\n> His fingers find the keychain\n> without looking. Three rings of nothing.\n\nThese lines narrate what the images should be doing. Cut them entirely. The poem's subject \u2014 a man starting at five who lets you sleep \u2014 arrives in \"His fingers find.\" That line is already the summary, and it works better as action than as explanation.\n\n**Clich\u00e9 / vagueness \u2014 line 10:**\n\n> and I watch his hand unfold\n> a newspaper no one folds anymore,\n\n\"Unfolds,\" \"no one folds anymore\" \u2014 this reads like a greeting-card shorthand. The poem is stronger when it stays in the man's hands:\n\n> His fingers find the keychain \u2014 three rings of nothing.\n> A wrinkle he repairs the way\n> you'd press a crease into a friend's jacket,\n> careful, almost embarrassed.\n\nThat's more specific and earned. Trust the domestic gesture over the abstraction.\n\n**Weak line break \u2014 line 15:**\n\n> The dog has been at it since three.\n> Some hare or fox on the property line\n> he'll never see.\n\n\"Has been at it\" is filler before \"some hare.\" Cut \"it\" \u2014 the poem doesn't need it, and the line stalls. Make \"Some hare or fox on the property line\" land as its own unit.\n\n**Direction:** The revision is",
