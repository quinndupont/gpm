  "final_poem": "In memory's shadowed hall,  \nA tale unfolds like an old play;   \nThe story of a lost cause,  \nIs written in its echoes repeating. \n\nMemory buries itself deep within us,  \nWhere all the past lives reside; \nIt keeps watch over our days gone by,  \nAnd whispers of laughter or sighs unseen. \n\nThe tale we tell to ourselves today,  \nIs a remnant from yesterday's dream; \nMemory remembers us as though there were no-one else here,  \nYet in every word it finds its echoes unfading.\n",
