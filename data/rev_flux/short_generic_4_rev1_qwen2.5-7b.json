      "draft": "In the cluttered attic, dust dances,\nA wooden comb, worn smooth by touch.\nLeaves of autumn crinkle beneath its bristles\u2014\nNot just oak and maple, but whispers,\nOf fingers that once braided hair.\n\nThe scent rises, earthy and familiar:\nClay soil from a garden where children played.\nRaindrops on green leaves in summer's heat,\nOr maybe the tang of sweat after play,\nAs laughter echoed through unguarded days.\n\nGripped tightly now, it\u2019s more than just thing;\nEach knot carved by time feels like memory.\nWood that creaks underfoot, silent song\nOf floors where steps and shoes once rang.\n\nA scent of apples, peeling skin and juice\u2014\nSweetness caught in every grain, the bite,\nTaste sharp as first love or a sudden truth:\nThat life is woven from moments tight.",
      "critique": "### What Works:\n- The imagery of tactile and olfactory details effectively evokes the sensory experience of memory.\n- The structure of the poem, with its focus on a single object, creates a cohesive narrative arc.\n- The use of slant rhymes adds depth to the poem's sound without strict adherence to traditional rhyme.\n\n### Issues (Type, Location, Direction):\n1. **Rhyme Scheme**: The draft does not follow the expected ABA scheme and lacks consistent meter. \n   - **Lines 3, 6, 7, 9, 12, 13, 15, 18** do not rhyme with \"dances\" (expected A pair).\n   - **Lines 5, 8, 11, 14, 17** do not rhyme with \"touch\" (expected B pair).\n\n2. **Meter**: The poem deviates from iambic pentameter.\n   - **Line 1, feet 1-4** contain variations: pyrrhic, trochee, spondee.\n\n3. **Weak Line Breaks**: Some lines could be restructured to enhance the flow and meaning.\n   - For example, \"Of fingers that once braided hair\" could be split into two lines for emphasis on the past action.\n\n4. **Clich\u00e9 Avoidance**: The poem avoids common clich\u00e9s well, but some phrases might still benefit from more specificity or fresh phrasing.\n   - \"Whispers of fingers that once braided hair\" could add a unique twist to the line.\n\n5. **Sentimentality**: The poem leans towards sentimentality in places where a more detached observation might be more effective.\n   - Consider grounding the memories in specific, concrete details rather than abstract emotions.\n\n### Directions:\n1. **Refine Rhyme Scheme**:\n   - Ensure that \"dances\" and \"touch\" are consistently used as end rhymes throughout the poem.\n   - Integrate slant rhymes effectively to maintain a cohesive sound without strict adherence to traditional rhyme.\n\n2. **Improve Meter**:\n   - Aim for iambic pentameter by adjusting line lengths and syllable counts.\n   - Use variations strategically to create rhythm rather than forcing uniformity.\n\n3. **Enhance Line Breaks**:\n   - Split lines where a pause would add emphasis or clarity, such as \"Of fingers that once braided hair.\"\n   - Ensure each line contributes meaningfully to the overall narrative flow.\n\n4. **Avoid Sentimentality**:\n   - Focus on specific sensory details and actions rather than abstract emotions.\n   - For example, instead of \"laughter echoed through unguarded days,\" consider a more concrete detail like \"children's giggles filled the air.\"\n\n5. **Specificity in Details**:\n   - Ground memories in tangible objects or events to avoid overgeneralization.\n   - For instance, replace \"raindrops on green leaves\" with",
