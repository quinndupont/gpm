He traces it with thumb,  \na groove of smoke, a scar that hums  \nbeneath the skin.  \n\nEach dusk, the bird pecks the same letter  \ninto the tree\u2019s knuckles\u2014*t*, *h*, *e*\u2014  \nuntil the trunk wears its own script,  \na ledger of thorns. The scent lingers  \nlike ink in a wound: the musk of feathers,  \nthe tang of coal, the ghost of a tongue  \nlicking the air.  \n\nHe repeats it, not as sound but as thing\u2014  \na carving, a breath, a bruise of meaning  \nthat does not fade. The ritual is the weight  \nof the word in his hand, the tree\u2019s  \nslow scarification, the way the scent  \nclings to his fingers like a second skin,  \nunspoken, unbroken.",
