      "critique": "**What\u2019s alive:**  \nThe metaphor of the cracked mirror as a \u201csilence stitched into glass\u201d is sharp and specific, grounding abstraction in a tangible object. The tension between absence and habit (\u201cgrooves of a splintered surface\u201d) and the unspoken dialogue between glass and hand evoke a visceral, unresolved tension. The poem avoids sentimental resolution by refusing to name the regret directly.  \n\n**Issues:**  \n- **Abstraction:** \u201cA thread pulled from the loom of your face",
