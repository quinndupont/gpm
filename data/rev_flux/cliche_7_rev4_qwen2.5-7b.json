      "draft": "In spring, we laughed as cherry blossoms fell,\nWhispering secrets under pale skies.\nSummer saw our hands tangled in sand,\nBuilding castles that time would rend apart.\n\nAutumn leaves crunched with a whispered truth:\nThe cold winds of doubt could never fully freeze the heart.\nWinter\u2019s frosty grip held us close and still\u2014\nA quiet huddle, each one feeling the other\u2019s chill.\n\nSpring again unfurled its verdant coat,\nBuds bursting into life from slumbering earth.\nSummer\u2019s sun baked memories of days past,\nEach ray a testament to shared lessons learned.\n\nAutumn came again with sharper gusts,\nLeaves swirling tales of seasons\u2019 ceaseless drift.\nBut within us, seeds were planted then\u2014\nRooted deep in the soil of steadfast trust.\n\nWinter clung on, testing our bonds' endurance,\nYet we found strength in holding tight through snow and sleet.\nFor in each turning season\u2019s cycle complete,\nOur friendship grew, a resilient tapestry.",
      "critique": "### What Works:\n- The imagery of seasons effectively symbolizes the passage and evolution of time, enhancing the theme.\n- The structure with quatrains provides a consistent rhythm that supports the poem's thematic development.\n\n### Issues (Type, Location, Direction):\n1. **Rhyme Scheme Deviations:**\n   - Line 2: \"skies\" does not rhyme with \"fell.\" Consider replacing \"pale skies\" or \"whispering secrets.\"\n   - Line 4: \"apart\" should ideally rhyme with \"sand,\" but it works as a slant rhyme. You could consider a stronger rhyme like \"land\" to maintain the structure.\n   - Line 6: \"heart\" does not rhyme with \"truth.\" A better choice might be \"truth\" to match \"fell.\"\n   - Line 8: \"chill\" should ideally rhyme with \"still,\" but it works as a slant rhyme. Consider revising for perfect rhymes.\n\n2. **Weak Line Breaks:**\n   - Lines like \"Building castles that time would rend apart\" could benefit from a stronger line break to emphasize the contrast between creation and destruction.\n   - \"A quiet huddle, each one feeling the other\u2019s chill\" might be more impactful with a different line break.\n\n3. **Clich\u00e9 Phrases:**\n   - The phrase \"Through thick and thin\" is avoided but can still feel clich\u00e9d in context. Consider rephrasing to something like \"in every challenge.\"\n\n4. **Abstract Concepts:**\n   - Some lines, such as \"A quiet huddle, each one feeling the other\u2019s chill,\" could be more concrete or vivid.\n\n### Directions:\n1. **Refine Rhyme Scheme:**\n   - Ensure perfect rhymes where possible (e.g., \"fell\" with \"chill,\" \"truth\" with \"heart\").\n   - Consider stronger slant rhymes if exact rhymes are challenging, but maintain the structure.\n\n2. **Improve Line Breaks:**\n   - Experiment with different line breaks to emphasize key phrases and create a more dynamic rhythm.\n   - For example, break \"Building castles that time would rend apart\" into two lines or adjust the placement of commas.\n\n3. **Avoid Clich\u00e9s:**\n   - Replace \"Through thick and thin\" with something like \"in every challenge,\" which conveys the same meaning but avoids clich\u00e9.\n\n4. **Enhance Vividness:**\n   - Make abstract concepts more concrete. For example, instead of \"A quiet huddle, each one feeling the other\u2019s chill,\" consider a more vivid description that captures the essence of companionship and support.\n\nWhen these revisions are made, this poem has found its shape.",
