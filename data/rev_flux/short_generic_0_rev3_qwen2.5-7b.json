      "draft": "Rain whispers secrets,\nlapping cold fingers at glass panes.\nA hand touches, feels droplets swell,\na pulse in the city\u2019s veins.\n\nStreets hum underfoot\u2014metal moans, grumbles deep;\nrivulets dance, whispering to puddles.\nBuses groan heavy with water, brakes squeak sharp notes,\nsirens cut through, slicing silence like a knife's edge.\n\nWindows rattle, frame by frame,\na relentless drumbeat on the skin.\nPurses clasp tighter as rain tightens its grip,\ncloaks drape silent sentinels against the storm\u2019s will.\n\nBicycles creak, tires slurp mud,\nleaves crinkle underfoot like brittle bones.\nA taxi honks once, twice\u2014a sound\nthat shatters the air\u2019s quiet, then fades.\n\nRain drums a lullaby to shutters' closing act;\nthe wind whips through gutters, snatching straws of light.\nHere and there, an occasional splash\nstarts a ripple in the dark, unspoken night.",
      "critique": "What works:\n- The opening lines effectively set a sensory tone, using \"whispers\" and \"lapping cold fingers\" to create an intimate, almost tender atmosphere.\n- The auditory imagery of \"metal moans, grumbles deep\" and the tactile sense of rain \"swelling droplets\" are vivid and engaging.\n\nIssues:\n- **Weak line breaks**: Some lines feel too long or could benefit from shorter breaks. For example, \"Streets hum underfoot\u2014metal moans, grumbles deep;\" could be split into two lines: \"Streets hum underfoot\u2014/ metal moans, grumbles deep.\"\n- **Clich\u00e9 avoidance**: While the poem avoids some common clich\u00e9s, it still uses \"patter\" in \"rivulets dance, whispering to puddles.\" Consider replacing this with something more unique.\n- **Overuse of alliteration and assonance**: Phrases like \"cloaks drape silent sentinels against the storm\u2019s will\" and \"leaves crinkle underfoot like brittle bones\" can be effective but might feel overdone. Try varying sentence structures to avoid repetition.\n\nDirections:\n1. Shorten some lines by splitting them into two or more shorter lines, particularly in sections with long runs of text.\n2. Replace \"patter\" with a unique term that captures the sound of rain on surfaces, such as \"sings\" or \"murmurs.\"\n3. Mix up sentence structures to vary the rhythm and avoid overusing alliteration and assonance.\n\nWhen done:\nThis poem has found its shape.",
