That soft refusal\nto give back the shape I came with.\n\nSomewhere ahead the woods have thickened\u2014\nnot into darkness yet, just a density,\nthe trees so close they're pressing trials\non my attention: each one holding its breath\n\nlike evidence. Underfoot the earth\nhas gone spongy, receptive, almost alive\nin its refusal of my weight.\nI can't leave it. That's the thing.\n\nThe air here has no purpose. It just sits\u2014\na pressure I'm part of rather than air,\nwhich is the exact definition of being\nstuck. My coat drapes over a branch.\nI am now a specimen\n\nthe landscape will keep, or nearly keeps:\nmy jacket dark against its green and brown\na way of marking territory without teeth,\njust hold. And behind me the fire\nhas gone small, almost domestic,\n\nwhich is worse\u2014duty made visible,\nthat little flame sending up its smoke\nto say *I'm here*, when what I mean\nis I want to be the kind of thing\nthat doesn't leave a trace except\n\nthe crater where my thinking was. The woods\nare not peaceful. They are actively\nunwelcoming, which is a different\nkind of hospitality\u2014no chairs,\nno clearing, just the constant close\n\nof leaf against cheek, the quiet\ninsistence that I belong to this\nless than I suspected. My name\nwon't grow here. That's the part\nI keep coming back to: not fame,\n\nbut the opposite\u2014the wood's perfect\ntolerance for whatever stays behind,\nwhich is everything I have right now,\nwhich is nothing, which is also\n\nthe only inheritance worth keeping.\nThe earth holds my heat already.\nThe earth will hold my heat forever.\n\nAnd somewhere someone is breaking through\ntheir own obligations, making room\nfor not-knowing. I don't know who they are.\nI don't need to. The silence here\ndoes its work the way a stone\n\non a pond does: it doesn't say anything,\nit just keeps sinking, and the ripples\nthat come after are not mine but theirs,\n\nand true. That's what I came for\u2014\nnot peace, not rest, but the precise\nunforgiving of anything that stops.\nThe earth has no use for stopping.\nIt has only pressure, and my shoe\n\nhas only worn a print. A print\nis almost gone. Almost the way\na name on a log is almost wood.",
      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe central conceit \u2014 that the woods resist \"stopping\" in a physical, geological sense \u2014 is genuinely interesting and earns its weight. The opening quatrain (lines 1\u20138) has real momentum: \"ground / memory / bending my heel / tectonic plates\" compresses time and scale into four lines with genuine compression. \"The pressure I came with\" gives the speaker a body, not just an abstraction.\n\n\"The earth holds my heat already. / The earth will hold my heat forever.\" \u2014 This is the poem's strongest moment of quiet, earned through accumulated detail rather than announced. It trusts the reader.\n\n\"not peace, not rest, but the precise / unforgiving of anything that stops\" lands because it arrives after a lot of sensory groundwork.\n\nThe phrase \"each one holding its breath / like evidence\" \u2014 this is alive: trees as agents doing something detectable, and \"evidence\" does real work without being stated as thesis.\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Abstraction bloat (lines 15\u201332).** The poem's second half dissolves into a cloud of abstract nouns: *stillness*, *silence*, *duty*, *obligations*, *not-knowing*. These words *defend* the poem against its own strangeness rather than embody it. \"The air here has no purpose. It just sits\" \u2014 this is the poem explaining itself, which means it hasn't yet found a way to inhabit that space through image alone.\n\n**Clich\u00e9 and inherited language (lines 10\u201312).** \"A density / the trees so close they're pressing trials / on my attention: each one holding its breath\" \u2014 \"pressing trials\" is a clich\u00e9 of transcendentalist landscape poetry. The poem's own geological angle gets abandoned for a humanistic paraphrase. Direction: strip this to what the body actually registers. What does it feel like when trees close in? Not *pressure* (used twice), not *trials*, but something more elemental.\n\n**Sentimentality / self-referential apology (lines 23\u201326).** \"I don't know who they are. / I don't need to.\" \u2014 this reads as the poet apologizing for having a thesis. The poem doesn't need to name its own subject. Cut or rewrite: let the silence do what it says.\n\n**Redundancy of \"woods\" (lines 27, 30\u201331).** \"The woods are not peaceful\" \u2014 this is line one restated. \"Active / different kind of hospitality\u2014no chairs, / no clearing\" \u2014 the poem has already done this argument in lines 9\u201314 with more force. Direction: cut these repetitions entirely or replace them with new material that *changes* what we've been told.\n\n**",

The geological conceit gets its own time: lines 5\u20138 build tectonic scale through concrete verbs (\"bends,\" \"compresses\") and keep the reader inside the physical experience rather than outside it.\n\n\"That's what I came for\u2014 / not peace, not rest, but the precise / unforgiving of anything that stops.\" This is the poem's real thesis, and it lands because it arrives after a lot of sensory groundwork. The antiphrasis (\"not peace, not rest\") does genuine work \u2014 it resists naming its own condition.\n\n\"the earth has gone spongy, receptive, almost alive / in its refusal of my weight.\" That \"refusal\" is doing what the poem wants elsewhere to explain (lines 15\u201320). The word earns its place here because it's grounded in texture.\n\n---\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Redundancy and explanation (lines 9\u201332).** The poem restates itself three times: lines 1\u20138, 9\u201314, 15\u201320 all cover the same ground \u2014 woods as resistance to stopping \u2014 but each time the language softens into paraphrase rather than deepening. **Direction:** Cut or radically compress every line between \"somewhere ahead\" (line 9) and \"the kind of patience that becomes harder than stone\" (line 8). The poem's real energy is in its opening eight lines, not its middle.\n\n**Abstraction and self-referencing (lines 15\u201320).** \"Air has no purpose. It just sits \u2014 / a pressure I'm part of rather than air.\" This is the poet *explaining* what the first quatrain showed. \"Duty made visible\" and \"not peace, not rest\" are the poem telling us its own meaning. **Direction:** Replace this passage entirely with sensory detail that enacts what it says abstractly. What does the speaker actually see or feel? Not \"duty,\" but something.\n\n**Clich\u00e9 (line 10).** \"A density / the trees so close they're pressing trials\" \u2014 \"pressing trials on my attention: each one holding its breath like evidence.\" \"Pressing trials\" is inherited language.

Not *pressure* (used twice), not *trials*, but something more elemental.\n\n**Sentimentality / self-deprecation (lines 23\u201326).** \"I don't know who they are.
