It earns its compression by doing two things at once: describing weather and implying the traveler's gradual awareness. The second sentence, \"You can see / / trees are wet, their needles holding / small silver messages on the glass of every leaf,\" is the poem's strongest moment: it stays in the physical world with real attention to light passing through water-coated needles. That's perception, not decoration.\n\nThe detail of the thumb leaving dark prints on a jacket collar \u2014 that's specific, earned, and quietly strange. The rain described as stinging without being hot \u2014 another precise sensory pairing.\n\nThe final three lines (\"Your breath comes back to you / each time like it's rehearsing for the first time\" through \"nothing / to slow it down\") build a real ending: compressed, quiet, with sound doing work that explanation resists. The last line's ambiguity (is this about listening? Is the sound metaphorical?) is productive.\n\nThe short lines and tight rhythm are mostly well-managed \u2014 there's enough variation in line length to avoid monotony.\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Sentimentality / editorializing \u2014 \"Do not think about which way.\"** The parenthetical intrusion into quotation marks is the poem's single largest failure: it tells the reader what to feel and do, then immediately retreats as if embarrassed by the revelation. This undermines everything else in the draft. **Direction:** Cut this entirely. Let the fog's behavior \u2014 getting thinner where attention isn't pooling \u2014 carry the meaning without a moral overlay.\n\n**Abstraction creeping in \u2014 \"a low weight / dragging across your hip bone.\"** \"Low\" is unnecessary; \"dragging\" is doing work that \"weight\" alone could do with more trust. The image is close, but it's still telling the reader what the sensation felt like rather than rendering it. **Direction:** Replace with a concrete physical detail \u2014 something that *is* dragging or scraping.\n\n**Clich\u00e9 proximity \u2014 \"small silver messages on the glass of every leaf.\"** \"Glass\" in quotation marks around \"silver\" is doing decorative work, and \"messages\" leans toward the inspirational. The fog light here is real; don't frame it as epiphany before the poem has earned one. **Direction:** Stay with the actual surface \u2014 wet needles reflecting water vapor, if that's what's happening.\n\n**Weak line breaks \u2014 \"on the collar of your jacket where your thumb / keeps leaving prints.\"** The break on \"where\" is doing nothing; it doesn't create tension or surprise. Consider whether this line needs to be two lines at all, or whether \"keeps",

Choose: \"on the collar of your jacket, darkening with each touch,\" or cut to a single line that trusts the image more.\n- **\"The sound carries because there's nothing / to slow it down.\"** This explanation weakens what the final image (branch tapping stone) was doing on its own.

      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n---\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe opening four lines have genuine momentum: \"The fog doesn't clear; it just gets thinner, / and that makes it scarier\" compresses a real perceptual event \u2014 the narrowing field of vision as fog lifts slightly at edges of attention \u2014 into two lines with economy. The shift from \"doesn't clear\" to \"gets thinner\" does actual work: the verb changes meaning mid-sentence.\n\n\"Water vapor \u2014 not silver messages but / thin skin on old metal, damp along each limb\" is the strongest passage in the poem. \"Thin skin on old metal\" earns its strangeness through specificity. The needles become a body covered in moisture rather than a surface for epigraphs. That's the kind of image that resists paraphrase.\n\n\"Dew still sits heavy in the creases / of what's left of morning \u2014 on the bark, / on the collar of your jacket, darkening with each touch\" lands because \"darkening with each touch\" does what the parenthetical in the previous draft failed to do: it gives the traveler a physical presence without editorializing.\n\nThe branch tapping stone at the close is a clean, quiet ending. The sound metaphor (\"rehearsing for the first time\") gets closer to the foggy ambiguity of not-yet-understanding than the earlier version's explanation.\n\n---\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Parenthetical intrusion \u2014 line 17:** \"Someone once said this\" is a dead weight. It introduces an absent speaker, a quotation, and a moral reading that the poem has already decided to avoid. The parenthetical in the previous draft (\"Do not think about which way\") was worse because it told the reader what to do. This one retreats into vagueness.\n\n**Direction:** Cut line 17 entirely. If this is a fork, let the traveler not know \u2014 or better: let the landscape hold two paths without naming them as choice.\n\n**Redundancy \u2014 lines 20\u201321:** \"The sound carries because there's nothing / to slow it down\" explains what the branch tapping stone already accomplishes. The final image is doing its job; the prose explanation weakens it. Trust the metaphor.\n\n**Direction:** Remove or rewrite: \"nothing / to slow it down\" is dead language, and so is the line as a whole in revision form.\n\n**Line 12\u201313 (near-identity):** \"on the collar of your jacket where your thumb keeps leaving prints\" \u2014 this reads as two lines that say the same thing. Choose: \"darkening with each touch,\" or cut to one line that trusts the image more. The repetition doesn't intensify here, it dilutes.\n\n**Direction:** Cut to \"on the collar of your jacket, darkening with each touch.\"\n\n---\n\nThe revision is nearly complete. Here's exactly what remains:\n\n---\n\nThe",
