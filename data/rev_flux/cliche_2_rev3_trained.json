      "draft": "**Pre-emptive**\n\nYou kept the porch light on the night\nmy car died, and I didn't say anything.\nYou never said anything.\n\nBut you came inside anyway\u2014\nnot because you heard me sigh,\nbut because the screen door swung shut\nand you were already reaching for a towel,\nthough your hands were dry,\nthough I was sitting in the dark\nwith my coat still on.\n\nI let you fold it. I let you hang it up.\nThat's when I noticed:\nyou'd hung mine too, without asking,\nthe way someone might rearrange\na jacket hanging crookedly\u2014\nno one's asked them to fix it,\nbut it looks better now and they did.\n\nYears later I remembered that night\nnot because of the light or the towel,\nbut because you matched my hanger style:\nsame brand, same color, same notch turned left.\nI'd have told you. I would have said\n*see, matching hangers*, something ridiculous like that,\nand we would have laughed and not known\nwe were already sharing a closet.\n\nSmall things. The salt again\u2014\nyou knew before I did,\nthe way someone knows the door is open\nin another room and simply closes it,\nnot dramatic, just a wall between two spaces\nand you sealed it without looking back.\n\nI kept track of these things the way a person\ncounts stones in a creek: one, two, three,\neach one plain until the total becomes\na\u6eaa\u6d41\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u603b\u6570\u6210\u4e86\n\n**A Current**\n\nYou once dried my glasses without asking.\nNot because you were faster than light\u2014\nyou just reached across the table\nthe way someone extends a towel\nto a friend about to step from bath.\n\nAt first I thought: *heaven sent,*\nthis quiet competence,\nthis hand that knows where another's wet edges are.\n\nBut you didn't know. You set them down.\nThen picked up my plate.\nThen got up for more water.\n\nAnd that was the deal\u2014\nyou never named it,\nbut I sat with your warmth\nthe way a fish stays in one place\nby making currents around itself:\neach small movement pre-emptive,\nnone deliberate enough to name.\n\nMonths later I found your jacket\non my chair, folded like mine,\nthat blue one with the snagged sleeve\u2014\nwe'd both worn it threadbare\nwithout noticing. You matched\nthe way two rivers meet\nnot in spectacle but in velocity,\neach going on as before,\nthe water simply thicker where they crossed.\n\nI didn't say anything about the hangers.\nI don't think you expected me to.\nThe salt, the glasses, the jacket:\nthese were not gestures\u2014they were\nthe quiet engine behind us,\npushing us closer without either of us\never having to explain where we were going\nor why our hands kept finding the same space.",
      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### What's Alive\n\nThe central conceit \u2014 intimacy built through pre-emptive gestures, not declarations \u2014 is the poem's real engine. The closing image of two rivers meeting \"not in spectacle but in velocity\" lands because it earns its metaphorical weight through the whole preceding narrative. The hanger matching scene also works: \"same brand, same color, same notch turned left\" does what a list of attributes should never do \u2014 it makes a mundane object strange and specific enough to carry emotional weight.\n\nThe line \"each small movement pre-emptive\" is a strong piece of naming that doesn't explain itself. It trusts the reader.\n\nThe fish metaphor in the middle section (\"I sat with your warmth / the way a fish stays in one place / by making currents around itself\") has real spatial logic \u2014 it earns its image because it's grounded in physical action rather than sentiment.\n\n### What Isn't Working\n\n**Sentimentality (lines 1\u20138 of \"A Current\" draft):**\nThe opening passage is where the poem loses control. \"You once dried my glasses without asking\" \u2014 this is a gesture, but the entire first eight lines are commentary on what it means. The reader doesn't need to be told *heaven sent* and *quiet competence.* Cut or radically compress the interpretive framing around the action. Let the drying-of-glasses scene do its own work. Direction: rewrite from \"You once dried my glasses without asking\" back, then test whether any of that theological/rhetorical language survives a second draft.\n\n**Clich\u00e9 / dead phrasing (throughout):**\n- \"the way someone knows the door is open in another room and simply closes it\" \u2014 this is a clich\u00e9 version of the fish metaphor.

      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### What's Alive\n\nThe closing image \u2014 \"the way two rivers meet / not in spectacle but in velocity, / each going on as before, / the water simply thicker where they crossed\" \u2014 is the poem's strongest moment. It earns its metaphor because it arrives after a sustained accumulation of specific domestic gestures and stays rooted in physical reality. The hanger passage (\"same brand, same color, same notch turned left\") also works because it trusts the reader to feel intimacy through catalog rather than explanation.\n\nThe fish staying in one place by making currents around itself is a genuinely original spatial conceit that does real work: it captures how small, unconscious body heat can hold another person without announcing possession. That passage needs revision but has genuine potential.\n\n### What Isn't Working\n\n**Sentimentality / explanatory commentary (lines 1\u20138 of \"A Current\"):**\n\"Years later I remembered that night / not because of the light or the towel, / but because you matched my hanger style: / same brand, same color, same notch turned left.\" \u2014 The poem is explaining itself here. It tells us what to notice before we've been placed in the scene. Cut \"I remembered that night\" entirely and start closer. Replace the list with a single concrete image of the hanger sitting on the chair.\n\n**Clich\u00e9 / dead phrasing:**\n- \"Not because you were faster than light\u2014 / you just reached across the table\" \u2014 \"faster than light\" is inert here; it's a joke that kills the seriousness the poem wants. Direction: remove or replace with something as precise and physical.\n- \"the way someone knows the door is open in another room and simply closes it\" \u2014 dead metaphor, generic to the point of greeting-card language. Direction: find an image specific to these two people; what does *this* closing look like?\n- \"not dramatic, just a wall between two spaces\" \u2014 vague abstraction. Direction: replace with something as concrete as the hanger passage.\n- \"a current no one has to explain\" \u2014 explanatory where the poem should be trusting its own images.\n\n**Weak line breaks (throughout):**\nMany lines break at syntactic dead spots or on filler words:\n- \"you matched / the way two rivers meet\" \u2014 \"matched\" is doing nothing here; it's a placeholder before the metaphor arrives.\n- \"the water simply thicker where they crossed\" \u2014 this is strong but the line after (\"I kept count\") drops into abstraction too soon.\n- \"not in spectacle but in velocity, / each going on as before\" \u2014 \"each going on as before\" is plain and slightly redundant; \"velocity\" does more work alone.\n\n**Structural pacing:**\nThe poem's middle section (lines 9\u201324) has too much generalizing and not enough image. The fish passage, the rivers metaphor, and the hangers are all strong because they're specific",

      "critique": "## Revision Workshop Response\n\n---\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe closing image \u2014 \"hung itself beside the door, / collar slightly damp from rain\" \u2014 is the poem's strongest moment. The coat hanging itself on a hinge, damp at the collar: this earns intimacy through physical detail rather than declaration. It trusts the reader to feel connection without naming it.\n\nThe hanger passage (\"same brand, same color, same notch turned left\") also works because it commits fully to catalog and stays rooted in sensory precision. \"Not dramatic\" / stone finding its own weight is a clean spatial conceit that doesn't over-explain.\n\nThe poem's best instinct: small gestures done without awareness \u2014 reaching for someone's glasses before they ask; drying them, then setting them down; folding the jacket folded longwise on the chair. These are the engine and the subject. The revision should stay inside those impulses.\n\n---\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Sentimentality / explanatory commentary (lines 1\u20138 of \"A Current\"):**\n\"Years later I noticed the hangers again. / Same rail, same angle, same friction kept / exactly where I'd left them.\" \u2014 This is telling the reader what to notice and how to feel about it. Cut or compress dramatically: let the image do its own work.\n\n**Clich\u00e9 / dead phrasing (line 1):**\n\"You once dried my glasses without asking\" \u2014 \"dried my glasses\" is vague; what kind of water? What glass? Direction: make this specific, as every other gesture in the poem should be. A raindrop on a windshield, a teardrop from reading.\n\n**Weak line breaks (throughout):**\nMany lines break at syntactic dead spots or on filler words:\n- \"the way someone reaches for the salt before you ask\" \u2014 \"before you ask\" is doing nothing; cut it.\n- \"a single unfolding into my field of view\" \u2014 \"field of view\" is generic. Direction: name where this happens (table, counter, coffee table).\n- \"I thought: *heaven sent*\" \u2014 direct speech in a poem that otherwise trusts image. Direction: replace with the physical gesture or cut entirely.\n- \"quiet competence. That hand / already knowing where my wet edges were\" \u2014 \"wet edges\" is vague and sentimental. Direction: what did it know? A specific contour, temperature, weight.\n\n**Abstraction (lines 17\u201324):**\nThe fish metaphor (\"not in spectacle but in velocity\"), the rivers crossing, \"a current no one has to explain\" \u2014 these step away from the poem's own material into generalized language. The hanger passage is stronger because it stays with the object. Direction: cut or replace each of these with a single concrete image that does what the metaphor tries to do.\n\n**Tonal inconsistency (lines 13\u201324):**\nThe poem shifts from intimate",
