  "final_poem": "In shadows where light barely strays,\nA heart whispers of days now gone.\nLeaves fall, each one a silent prayer,\nDrifting into winter's mournful song.\n\nThrough corridors of forgotten smiles,\nEchoes linger, soft and cold.\nWindows gaze at skies grown distant,\nClouds like memories, held aloft.\n\nIn gardens where laughter once danced,\nNow solitude reigns without end.\nStone paths worn by footsteps lost,\nLead to a silence, unconfended.\n\nLost are the hands that held so tight,\nThe voices silenced in night's embrace.\nYet in each touch of remembered warmth,\nA spark ignites, seeking its place.",
