      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe closing sequence \u2014 \"something / in your throat / would not let you answer\" \u2014 is the poem's strongest moment. That compression of physical obstruction into a single bodily gesture earns its weight. The reader feels silence without being told to feel it.\n\n\"Heating water in a pan\" also works: domestic, precise, sensory. It resists the expected \"burning fire\" and stays with the mundane. The radiator voice above the hour is effective \u2014 short, specific, rhythmic enough that repetition could be considered here (though not yet).\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Abstraction / vagueness: lines 16\u201318**\n\"These are the things\" impulse. \"A hand on the window glass you hadn't cleaned yet.\" The \"you hadn't cleaned yet\" is a piece of furniture tagged with meaning instead of rendered as texture. More importantly, \"a visit, a hand\" \u2014 this tells rather than shows. What does the snow actually do? What gesture or pressure? The poem earns its silence through concrete action elsewhere; here it retreats into summary.\n\n**Direction:** Replace the abstraction with what the speaker *sees* and *hears*. What kind of hand? Cold, wet, tentative? What glass \u2014 fogged, still-warm from indoor air?\n\n---\n\n**Line 14: \"it was a visit\"**\nThis is the poem explaining itself. The snow on the sill already did this work through image; the line breaks and rephrasing undo that.\n\n**Direction:** Cut or rewrite entirely in terms of sensory detail \u2014 what does the snow actually touch, how long does it linger?\n\n---\n\n**Line 12: \"Snow on the sill / was not a landscape\"**\nThis is the thesis statement the poem should never make. It names its own subject and tells the reader to interpret.\n\n**Direction:** Remove entirely. Let the pan of water, the wet leather coat \u2014 let *those* do the work of establishing this as interior rather than exterior.\n\n---\n\n**Weak line break: \"like a small commission\" (line 8)**\nA simile that doesn't land because it's too narrow and specific to parse quickly. It reads like an attempt at wit or idiom substitution (\"small commission\" for \"small noise\").\n\n**Direction:** If the leather coat ringing matters, make it visible \u2014 what does it sound like? A bell? A click? The poem is stronger with direct texture than with this kind of secondary metaphor.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Form\n\nThe short lines (5\u20139 syllables) are working well as a constraint. Repetition could be introduced more deliberately in later drafts, but the final image shows that instinct already \u2014 \"something / in your throat\" earns its compression.\n\nThis poem has found its shape.",
