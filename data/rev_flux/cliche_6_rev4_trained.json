      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### What's Alive\n\nThe poem has a genuine engine. The impulse to avoid the easy \"eyes met\" route is paying off in lines 15\u201320, where the body's response \u2014 sternum shifting toward the chair's edge, a muscle pulling like a hinge that hasn't been used in years but suddenly knows exactly where it lives \u2014 lands because it stays inside sensation rather than declaring meaning. The specificity of \"a muscle pulling / like a hinge that hasn't been used / in years\" earns its abstraction because every word before it is concrete.\n\nThe detail of his thumb dragging along the rim of the glass, leaving no mark \u2014 yet \u2014 also works. It's small, physical, and trusts the reader to feel the gesture without being told what it means.\n\nThe split sentence \"tenses, / relaxes\" does real work: the line break isolates each verb so briefly that the body almost spasms on the page. That's good craft.\n\n### What Isn't Working\n\n**Sentimentality / editorializing (lines 13\u201314):**\n\"The room has gone / a little thin, the walls\ncreasing at the edges\nthe way water does\nwhen something settles into it.\"\nThis is where the poem stops trusting itself. The walls creasing \"like water\" \u2014 that's decorative metaphor, not discovered metaphor. It tells the reader what to feel rather than letting the earlier, stranger details do the work. Direction: cut or replace with a detail as specific and unexplained as \"his left hand opens on its own.\" What does *this* look like? Not water settling.\n\n**Abstraction creeping in (line 19):**\n\"quiet / in her palm.\" Quiet what? The poem has already shown the orange sections sitting in their skin \u2014 that's quiet. Direction: delete or replace with a sensory verb or image.\n\n**Redundancy (lines 27\u201330):**\nThe grater continues, his thumb drags along the rim, leaving no mark \u2014 yet. This is the same gesture repeated without development. The poem needs to move into consequence or turn. Direction: what happens after he leaves \"no mark \u2014 yet\"? What does she see in that moment of potential? That's where the real poem lives.\n\n**Line breaks are mostly working**, but lines 15\u201320 need tightening as noted above. Line 30 (\"She feels / her sternum shift\") is weak because it echoes line 19 almost exactly \u2014 two consecutive lines about sensation, neither sharpened.\n\n### Summary Direction\n\nThe draft has found its shape in the second half (lines 14\u201325). Revise outward from there: cut the explanatory passage at lines 13\u201314 entirely, and deepen the final gesture of his thumb. Trust the physical specificity more \u2014 \"no mark \u2014 yet\" is already doing the abstraction for you. The poem knows what it's about",

      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### What's Alive\n\nThe poem has found its shape. The second half is where the writer's instinct has led them: lines 15\u201320 are the strongest writing in this piece, and the momentum builds through to the close.\n\n**Lines 19\u201324:** \"She can see / his breathing soften \u2014 not stopping, / exactly, but finding / a new speed for it. Close to sleep.\" \u2014 This is where the poem earns its subject. The final gesture (the softening breath) arrives after building with the body's actual responses: muscles pulling like hinges, sternum shifting toward chair-edge, hands opening and closing without reason. The reader *feels* what happens before anyone names it.\n\n**Line 25:** \"The thumb keeps dragging.\" \u2014 A single verb does more than any explanation could. This is the poem's real ending posture.\n\n**The entire final section (lines 14\u201330):** Trusts the physical world entirely. The orange peeling continues while attention has shifted elsewhere; the glass rim, the grater, the engine outside \u2014 these details stay alive even as the two people hold still. That's how a poem about intimacy should function: rooted in what *happens*, not what is announced.\n\n### What Isn't Working\n\nThere are only three specific failure types worth naming:\n\n**1. Redundancy / structural slack (lines 9\u201312):**\n\"Across the table his jaw\ndoes something \u2014 tenses,\nrelaxes \u2014 and the light\nhums off the laminate\"\n\nThis is weaker than the revised draft, which was already thin here. \"Hums off the laminate like it's learning a new frequency\" is decorative abstraction that doesn't earn its place in a poem this grounded elsewhere. Direction: cut or replace with something as specific as what follows \u2014 the hand opening on its own.\n\n**2. Abstraction at line 17 (the hinge simile):**\n\"like a hinge that hasn't been used\nin years but suddenly\nknows exactly\nwhere it lives.\" \u2014 The abstraction here (\"knows exactly where it lives\") is doing what the final lines do better, and later in the poem's development. Direction: cut or compress; let \"a muscle pulling / like a hinge that hasn't been used\" land as two clean images.\n\n**3. Line 28\u201329 (the engine noise):**\n\"Outside, someone starts\na engine, cuts it,\nstarts it again,\"\n\nThis is the weakest moment in the poem \u2014 a clich\u00e9 car-starting image dropped into what otherwise has no background noise. It feels like filler to complete the corridor-as-corridor image. Direction: either make this specific (which engine? what kind of silence) or remove it entirely, as it doesn't earn its place beside \"the room has gone / the slightest lean.\"\n\n### Summary\n\nThe revision is nearly complete",

      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### What's Alive\n\nThe closing section is the poem's real engine. Lines 15\u201320 have arrived at what this piece has been building toward: the body's response to unspoken attention, rendered in precise physical detail rather than announced as feeling. \"His left hand opens on its own\" \u2014 that verb *opens* does more work than any explanation could provide. The room creasing like water, the knuckles whitening slightly, the thumb dragging along the glass rim: these are the poem's strongest moments because they stay in the body and the object-world.\n\nThe engine noise (lines 25\u201327) is a genuine weakness \u2014 it introduces background that doesn't belong to this intimate scene. \"Freezing / in a corridor when the sprinkler clicks\" flattens what should be specific, and \"pushing back\" (line 16) drifts toward summary where the poem has been working hard with concrete muscle-memory.\n\nThe final image \u2014 his hand dropping from the glass, water untouched, watching her finish \u2014 earns its stillness. The closing line (\"the ordinary thing / between two people who have almost / done something\") risks abstraction but lands because the entire body of the poem has been doing *almost* that work already.\n\n### What Isn't Working\n\n**1. Redundancy / structural slack (lines 9\u201312):**\n\"Across the table his jaw\ndoes something \u2014 tenses,\nrelaxes \u2014 and the light\nhums off the laminate\"\n\nThe \"jaws do something\" gesture is repeated in lines 16\u201317 (\"his jaw does something \u2014 tenses, / relaxes \u2014 and the laminate / hummed like it found / a new pitch\"). Direction: choose one. The revision already did this better.\n\n**2. Abstraction / explanatory summary (lines 15\u201318):**\n\"His left hand opens on its own,\nfingers spreading wide\nas though preparing\n\na cradle. *The wall creases\nat the edges,*\nthe way water does\n\nwhen something settles in it.\" \u2014 The asterisk indicates this was cut from revision, but the passage as a whole shows what happens when the poem explains instead of showing. \"As though preparing / a cradle\" is the writer naming their own metaphor. Direction: delete or compress to two clean images.\n\n**3. Clich\u00e9 / decorative abstraction (line 17):**\n\"The laminate hummed like it found\na new pitch.\" \u2014 This is what the revision's opening cut (\"hums off the laminate\") was already weak. Direction: cut entirely, or replace with something as specific as \"the way water does.\"\n\n**4.

      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### What's Alive\n\nThe closing section, lines 15\u201320. \"His hand drops from the glass. He doesn't touch his water.\" That's the poem's real ending \u2014 specific, quiet, earned by what came before. The body has done everything; no summary is needed.\n\nLines 8 and 9: \"and the laminate / hummed like it found / a new pitch\" \u2014 this is where the revision broke through its own draft. It commits to an object (laminate) rather than floating away, and the verb *hummed* does more work than any explanation could.\n\nLine 21: \"each segment drops, / catching on its neighbor\" \u2014 concrete, visual, restrained. The orange doing physics is a good move.\n\nThe overall architecture of moving from action to stillness in the final three stanzas works.\n\n### What Isn't Working\n\n**Redundancy (lines 9\u201312):**\n\"The laminate hummed like it found / a new pitch\" \u2014 repeated essentially as \"the laminate hummed lower, / a thin vibration along the grain.\" Direction: choose one. The revision's version is stronger because it stays with the object and resists explanation.\n\n**Abstraction / explanatory summary (lines 15\u201318):**\n\"The wall darkens at the edges, each corner\npulling inward like water\nsettling into a new stillness\" \u2014 \"wall darkens,\" \"water settling,\" \"new stillness.\" Three abstractions in three lines. Direction: replace with two concrete images that do what this passage tries to do.\n\n**Clich\u00e9 / decorative abstraction (lines 17\u201320):**\n\"The way you'd hold a stone found on a walk \u2014\nordinary, but this room has shifted now,\nthe table flexing ever so\nslightly where their hands rest.\" \u2014 \"shifted,\" \"flexing,\" \"ever so\" are all summary. Direction: cut the metaphor entirely and stay in the physical evidence.\n\n**Clich\u00e9 (line 25):**\n\"Not stopping exactly, / but finding\na new slow\" \u2014 this is a feeling named, not rendered. Direction: show what *finding* that slow looks like or sounds like.\n\n**Engine noise (lines 23\u201327):**\n\"Outside, an old truck idles then\nclicks back into gear \u2014 and both of them\nstill the way you still\nin a corridor when nothing happens.\" \u2014 This is the revision's opening cut, which was already weak. Direction: cut entirely. The poem doesn't need ambient noise from outside to establish stillness inside.\n\n**Direction summary:**\n- Cut or compress any passage where the poem explains what it should show.\n- Stay with objects and surfaces; let the room be a character through its own physics, not through personified verbs (\"hummed,\" \"creased\").\n- The closing section is nearly perfect",

The rind curls\nagainst her thumbnail, fine dust\nrising.\n\nAcross the table his jaw\ndoes something \u2014 tenses,\nrelaxes \u2014\n\nand the laminate\nhummed lower,\na thin vibration along the grain.\n\nHer sternum leans forward slightly.\nNot reaching \u2014 leaning\nthe way a tree leans\ntoward the sun. Her palm\ncloses around the rind\nthe way you'd hold a stone found on a walk,\n\nordinary, but this room has shifted now,\nthe table flexing ever so\nslightly where their hands rest.\n\nThe grater turns its slow\ncircle. Outside, an old truck idles then\nclicks back into gear \u2014 and both of them\nstill the way you still\n\nin a kitchen when nothing happens.\nHis knuckles tighten slightly open.\n\nEach segment drops,\ncatching on its neighbor \u2014\n\nand she can see his breathing soften,\nnot stopping exactly,\n\nbut the shallow draw\nof breath along the sternum, the chest\ngiving a centimeter toward the table.\n\nHer thumb finds the glass too.\nNeither leaving nor marking yet \u2014 just the cool\n\nedge under skin, the ordinary thing\nbetween two people who have almost\ndone something and the orange releases\n\nits small sound letting go,\neach segment hitting the plate\nwith separate impact.\n\nHis hand drops from the glass. He doesn't touch his water. He watches her\nfinish. She holds the rind against her palm\nthe way you'd hold a stone found on a walk \u2014\n\nnot ordinary, but the weight of it.\nThe kitchen keeps its one cool line under two sets of skin.\n\nHe breathes with his sternum again,\na shallow draw, the chest\ngiving toward the table's edge,\n\nand she watches his thumb press\nthe glass where he seats himself.",
