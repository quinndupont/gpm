The wall remains\na constant width, and the picture stays hung.\n\nThe zipper on my sister's jacket has learned\nthe exact length of her throat\u2014\nthat particular tug at 4:23 AM when she pulls it down,\nbefore her mind has named the temperature,\nbefore the body decides to shiver.\n\nI found a toast rack in the cabinet dated 1976.\nEach slot is slightly narrower than the last,\na millimeter stolen from every morning.\nThe bread fits anyway. No one at the table\nhas ever suspected time of this precision.\n\nIn the basement, the fluorescent light above the stairs\nflickers once at 12:01 AM and again at 365.4 days later,\nnot failing but performing a small, mechanical\nhesitation\u2014no one home, no one checking,\njust the ballast's soul letting go for an evening.\n\nMy mother's hands have widened.\nShe says it isn't her body but the chairs\nthey sit in all day, the kitchen table\nthat has worn into the shape of every family member's\nrepetition. She traces a crease and calls it mine.\n\nA switchplate on the living room wall holds a dent\nnot from anything physical hitting it\u2014\nthat would be too obvious\u2014but from the house\nexpanding in summer, pulling inward at the studs,\nand the plastic giving ever so slightly.\nNo one remounts it. The gap is now part of the room.\n\nAt 2 AM the coffee maker clicks on by itself.\nThe water heats what isn't there.\nThis happens four nights out of seven.\nOn the fifth, something in the kitchen\nhas kept perfect stillness\u2014absolute,\nthe way a lake doesn't know it's freezing.",
      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe dent in the switchplate \u2014 \"not from anything physical hitting it\" is the strongest single line in the poem because it earns its strangeness through precise, almost scientific detail before the reader has any emotional stake. The fluorescent light flickering at precisely 12:01 AM and again after a year also lands because it's specific enough to feel like an observation rather than a mood.\n\nThe toast rack with narrowing slots is strong \u2014 \"a millimeter stolen from every morning\" gives the abstraction of time a concrete verb, and the final image (no one at the table has ever suspected) trusts the reader without explaining too much. The jacket zipper at 4:23 AM is alive because it's grounded in a real hour with a body doing something before consciousness catches up.\n\nThe light switch \"performing a small, mechanical / hesitation\" \u2014 that's good sensory language for an object that should just click but doesn't.\n\n---\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Abstraction bloat (lines 13\u201317 of the draft).** The mother's hands have widened into a paragraph about chairs and tables wearing shapes from repeated sitting. This is the poem *telling* us what time does instead of showing it. \"She traces a crease and calls it mine\" \u2014 this could work, but it's buried in explanatory prose around it: \"My mother's hands have widened / She says it isn't her body.\" The line-by-line explanation drains the image's power. **Direction:** Cut or rewrite entirely into a single concrete moment. What does she actually see? A crease in what? Let the reader infer.\n\n**Sentimentality (lines 21\u201324).** \"At 2 AM the coffee maker clicks on by itself. / The water heats what isn't there.\" This is a beautiful image, but then \"something in the kitchen / has kept perfect stillness\" moves into vague emotional summary \u2014 \"absolute\" is doing that work poorly. **Direction:** End with the physical fact: what does the water do? Stay with the object's behavior.\n\n**Clich\u00e9 by accident (line 10).** \"The bread fits anyway\" \u2014 this reads as a throwaway line that could fill a gap, and it's close enough to \"no matter how much I love you, you'll never fit\" territory. It softens what was sharpening. **Direction:** Make the bread not fit or barely fit. The friction will do more.\n\n**Redundancy / structural padding (lines 18\u201320).** The basement passage has three separate domestic objects \u2014 a switchplate, a floor, and a coffee maker \u2014 but each gets its own paragraph with essentially the same move: object does something unusual; no one notices. Three examples of the same pattern is weaker than one that's fully developed. **Direction:** Choose one",
