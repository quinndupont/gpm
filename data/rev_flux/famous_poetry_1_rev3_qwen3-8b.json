      "critique": "**What\u2019s alive:**  \nThe poem\u2019s imagery is vivid and cohesive, with a consistent natural metaphor (willow, river, moon) that evokes a quiet, meditative tone. The structure (quatrains, rhyme scheme) supports a lyrical flow, and the final lines tie the willow\u2019s role as a silent witness to the theme of storytelling.",
