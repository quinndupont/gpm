      "draft": "The hallway stretches past the door\nthat leads to nothing, and the switch\nhas been on all week for no one.\nI have memorized the dust-crawl\nacross the baseboard near the window,\nhow it thins where light touches.\n\nThere is a glass in the hall closet\nwith water in it since March.\nThe bird has stood behind it once,\njust outside my seeing, and I noticed\nbecause something wet left its print\n\non the cabinet wood \u2014 a footprint\nsmaller than a child's pinky, dark\nas a smudge on a lens. I held the glass\nto the wall between us until\nthe hall widened into the room\n\nwhere the curtains pool against the chair.\nA book open to pages no one turns\nhas gathered its own small history \u2014\ndust lines along the dog-ears,\na thumbprint I can't place.\n\nI set the glass down. The water\nholds what it always holds: the oval\nof a ceiling, and somewhere in that circle\na fly has been buzzing since Tuesday.\nThe bird stood very still behind it\n\nthe way you hold still against a wall\nwhen something is happening outside your body \u2014\na window I can't quite reach,\nsay, or the faucet where water pools\nthen vanishes before you touch.\n\nI went to the window. The yard was bare.\nA cardigan on the hook had gone pink\nin direct sunlight. I adjusted it.\nThe bird had moved closer to the glass.\nWe were both studying the same nothing \u2014\n\nthe ceiling, the fly, the dust\nthat settles and is named for no one,\nthe quiet that fills a hallway\nwhen every surface agrees\nto keep its mouth shut.\n\nThen the curtains stirred.\n\nNot wind. Not anything so clean.\nSomething in the house decided\nto test the windows, and the curtains \u2014\nwhich had hung there doing nothing\nsince October \u2014 went first,\n\nand I heard the bird turn\ninside its skull, like a stone\nrolling off a table and stopping\nat some smaller ledge where light can't reach,\nand we both stood with our faces\n\npressed to that shifting cloth.\nThe curtain divided us\nthe way a door divides a room\ninto before-you-know-and-after.\nI watched the dust motes\n\ndance along the seam\nwhere curtains meet wall. The bird\nwas still.

      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe central conceit \u2014 that the speaker and bird are both trapped inside their own awareness, neither aware of being watched until a shared moment forces recognition \u2014 is genuinely well-conceived. The poem earns this through meticulous domestic detail rather than announcing it. \"I set the glass down. The water / holds what it always holds: the oval / of a ceiling\" \u2014 that line break after \"down\" creates a small, felt pause where the speaker's body registers before consciousness catches up.\n\nThe closing sequence (curtains close, hall goes dark beneath water in glass) lands with real weight because it arrives through accumulated stillness rather than declaration. The final image \u2014 \"I looked at the glass and saw only / the ordinary ceiling, the ordinary fly\" \u2014 earns its ordinariness precisely because everything preceding it has been so specific.\n\nThe structural move from hallway to room to window back to hallway creates a genuine circuit of perception that mirrors the poem's theme.\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Sentimentality / emotional overexplanation (lines 59\u201364):**\n> \"Then the curtains stirred.\n> Not wind. Not anything so clean.\"\n> \u2014 *Something in the house decided\n> to test the windows, and the curtains \u2014*\n> \n> *which had hung there doing nothing\n> since October \u2014 went first.*\n> \n> *and I heard the bird turn\n> inside its skull, like a stone\n> rolling off a table and stopping\n> at some smaller ledge where light can't reach,\n> and we both stood with our faces*\n> \n> *pressed to that shifting cloth.\n> The curtain divided us\n> the way a door divides a room\n> into before-you-know-and-after.*\n\nThe bird \"turning inside its skull\" \u2014 this is the poem's one metaphor that reaches for easy feeling (\"like a stone rolling off a table\") and then retreats. \"A smaller ledge where light can't reach\" is vague enough to be decorative, not observed. The extended door-as-division-of-the-room conceit in lines 61\u201364 explains what the curtain already did: it created a boundary between two spaces of awareness. This explanation weakens the image's power.\n\n**Direction:** Cut or radically compress these explanatory lines. Let the curtain do its work silently, then move into the next moment \u2014 the bird stepping through. Trust the reader and trust the image.\n\n---\n\nThe poem is strong in its domestic specificity, its attention to what light does on surfaces, its refusal of grand declaration. The final turn works because it stays quiet. The revision direction is: tighten the ending by removing explanatory paraphrase; let images carry the emotional weight.",
