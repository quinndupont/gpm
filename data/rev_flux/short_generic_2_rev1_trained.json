      "draft": "# The Man in the Kitchen\n\nHe keeps the living room window\nsealed against whatever left outside \u2014\na small plastic baggie\ntaped over the lower pane,\nthe upper one kept clean enough\nfor him to read the newspapers through.\n\nMarch turns into April\nand there is no event he misses.\n\nThe drapes, though. The drapes\nhang heavy in their tracks,\ncotton and polyester holding\ntheir pleats against a draft\nthat has not yet crossed the threshold.\n\nHis coffee grows cold.\nThe cup darkens a ring\non the table's oak,\nand under that \u2014 circles\ngoing soft with dust,\nthe slow forgetting of places\nhe might wipe before it set.\n\nSomewhere in the neighborhood\na sprinkler wakes at five,\nwater finding the lawns\nwith its pale, mechanical touch,\nbut he hears it only when it stops,\nthat hold-between-rings\nof sound that leaves the air\nflat as a lake without wind.\n\nThe dust on the light fixture\nhas not yet thinned enough\nto catch his eye. The boots\nby the door have gone\nthe color of March \u2014\ngummid soles leaching into uppers,\ncaked with whatever\nhe dragged across ice.\nThey know more about spring\nthan he does.\n\nHe peels an orange at the counter.\nThe bright segments separate\nagainst the green cloth he uses\nfor this, and each one curls\ntoward his thumb \u2014 a small\nact of opening nobody asked for.\n\nOutside, the birch tree\nhas already dropped its flowers.\nThey lie in the grass like something\nthe ground swallowed without chewing,\nstill damp, still white,\nand no one comes to gather them.\n\nHe cuts the orange into wedges.\nOne falls. He picks it up.\nIt is warm inside. The radio\nplays talk shows he disagrees with.\nThe drain holds a glass\nhalfway through its life \u2014\nhe washed it before, in another life,\nset it down, and now\nthe water has forgotten\nwhat it was invited to do.\n\nSpring did not come for him.\nIt sat on the sill\nand stopped breathing. He\ncontinued arranging his lemons\nby density, by sourness,\na small architecture no one\nwill walk into.\n\nThe dust on the ceiling fan\nhas not moved. The boots\nhave softened into their new color.\nHe will wear them out to the store,\nreturn them back across the sidewalk,\nnot once but twice,\nand each time the season\nbetween his steps stays\nthe way it was \u2014 a thing\nhe carried without noticing,\na door he opened\nwith his mouth, then closed.",
      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe final six lines are the strongest passage in this poem, and they earn their weight because everything preceding them built toward it with genuine restraint:\n\n> \"a thing / he carried without noticing,\n> a door he opened\n> with his mouth, then closed.\"\n\nThat closing image \u2014 spring as something ingested, not encountered \u2014 is precise, strange, and the character's obliviousness becomes physical. The body moving through winter and into boots that soften \"into their new color\" also works: it makes perception (or lack thereof) visible.\n\nThe orange-peeling sequence from lines 43\u201352 has real texture. Each detail \u2014 segments curling toward his thumb, the radio playing talk shows he disagrees with, the glass halfway through its life \u2014 accumulates without overstating. The domestic objects *become* the poem's subject rather than decorating it.\n\nThe dust on the ceiling fan not moving / boots having softened \u2014 that parallel earns its place because both lines are doing similar work: showing awareness absent where expected.\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Clich\u00e9 and dead phrasing (throughout):**\n\"flat as a lake without wind,\" \"a small architecture no one will walk into,\" \"set it down, and now / the water has forgotten / what it was invited to do.\" These are the poem's own avoidance of its own brief \u2014 decorative language where plainness should be. The lake line especially reaches for atmosphere that belongs to a different poem. Direction: strip every simile. If the thing can't be said in one or two concrete images, cut it.\n\n**Overcrowded domestic detail (lines 13\u201326):**\nThe drapes, the coffee ring, the table dust, the boots \u2014 this is accumulation without selection. Each object gets a line or two and then sits inert. The direction on the brief asked for \"minimal\" objects carrying weight. Right now there are too many carrying no weight at all. Direction: choose three domestic details that *distinguish* this character's perception from everyone else's. Cut the rest.\n\n**Tonal inconsistency / editorializing (lines 27\u201336):**\n\"The drapes, though.\" \"Somewhere in the neighborhood\" \u2014 these lines step outside the character into a narrator offering information or commentary. The mechanical sprinkler waking at five is a nice image, but \"he hears it only when it stops\" adds an interpretive frame (\"hold-between-rings / of sound that leaves the air / flat as a lake\") that belongs to the poet, not the character. Direction: let the drapes just hang heavy \u2014 don't name the reading of them.\n\n**Line 39 (\"still damp, still white\"):**\nRedundancy without emphasis. \"Still\" appears twice in three lines elsewhere (line 48), which reads as a habit rather than deliberate compression. Direction: choose one",
