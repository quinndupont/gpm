  "final_poem": "In twilight's hollow, where shadows play\nA ghost of you lingers, fading away\n Memories once warm now chill to bone\nEchoes of laughter, whispers overthrown\n\nThe wind it howls like a mournful sigh\nAs I wander through fields where we used to lie\nSummer sunsets that we'd chase and share\nNow reduced to embers, beyond repair\n\nTime, the thief, stole moments from our past\nLeaving me with tears, forever to last\nIn dreams, your smile still lights up my night\nBut dawn brings wakefulness, a hollow light",
