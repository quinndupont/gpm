      "critique": "**What\u2019s alive:**  \nThe poem\u2019s focus on absence through sensory details (perfume, static, empty chair) and fragmented structure effectively mirrors the fractured logic of loss. The clock\u2019s stalled hands and the photograph\u2019s missing face anchor the absence in concrete, unusual imagery. The final lines\u2014door creaking open to an empty room\u2014create a visceral, unresolved tension.  \n\n**Issues:**  \n- **Clich\u00e9**: \u201cFootsteps echo in an empty hallway\u201d repeats the overused metaphor of echo for absence. Replace with a more original sensory detail (e.g., *Footsteps dissolve in an empty hallway*).  \n- **Redundancy**: \u201cLingers\u201d appears twice (\u201cscent\u2026lingers,\u201d \u201clast letter\u2019s crease lingers\u201d) and feels repetitive. Merge or rephrase to avoid repetition.  \n- **Weak line break**: The line \u201cits edges curling like a question left unanswered\u201d relies on a simile that feels derivative. Replace with a more original metaphor or concrete image.  \n- **Sentimentality**: The closing lines (\u201c",
