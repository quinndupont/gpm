      "draft": "Spring's whisper wakes us from slumber,\nIn budding trees, we find our first venture.\nTogether, we plant seeds of hope and trust\u2014\nroots deepening as days are crushed in mist.\n\nSummer's sun blazes, fierce and bright,\nwe shelter under leafy canopies tight.\nLaughter soars where the light dances free,\nas shared dreams catch like a butterfly.\n\nAutumn leaves fall, gold to crimson hue,\nour paths diverge with whispers of truth.\nFarewells are brief; we know the cycle spins\u2014\neach step forward means what comes within.\n\nWinter's hush, a blanket soft and still,\nwe gather by fireside, warm and enthral.\nMemories mingle, stories untold,\nin quiet moments where hearts truly fold.\n\nThrough every season, change whispers low,\nfriendship blooms in cycles, ebb and flow.",
      "critique": "What works:\n- The imagery of seasons effectively symbolizes the growth and changes in friendship.\n- The structure of tercets creates a rhythmic flow that mirrors the cyclical nature of seasons.\n\nIssues:\n1. **Rhyme Scheme**: The current rhyme scheme (AABC DDEF GHIJ KKLL MM) does not match the expected ABAB pattern, which disrupts the intended form and rhythm.\n   - **Direction**: Revise to fit a consistent ABAB rhyme scheme where possible. For example, adjust lines 3 and 4: \"Together, we plant seeds of hope and trust\u2014/ roots deepening as days are blurred in mist.\"\n\n2. **Weak Line Breaks**: Some line breaks do not effectively separate ideas or create meaningful pauses.\n   - **Direction**: Consider breaking lines to enhance the flow and meaning. For instance, break \"Laughter soars where the light dances free,\" into two lines: \"Laughter soars / where the light dances free.\"\n\n3. **Abstract Language**: Some phrases are abstract and could benefit from more concrete imagery or specific details.\n   - **Direction**: Replace vague terms with more vivid descriptions. For example, change \"shared dreams catch like a butterfly\" to \"shared dreams flutter like butterflies caught in sunlight.\"\n\n4. **Sentimentality**: The poem leans towards a sentimental tone at times, which may detract from the natural world imagery.\n   - **Direction**: Balance the emotional content with concrete nature details. For instance, instead of \"Farewells are brief,\" try something more specific: \"Farewells whispered in leaves that rustle free.\"\n\n5. **Weak Line Breaks and Phrasing**: Some lines could be rephrased to improve clarity and impact.\n   - **Direction**: Refine phrasing for stronger imagery. For example, change \"Memories mingle, stories untold\" to \"Memories mingle, tales untold in quiet whispers.\"\n\nWhen these adjustments are made:\nThis poem has found its shape.",
