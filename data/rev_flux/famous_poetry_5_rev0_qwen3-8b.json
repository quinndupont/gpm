  "final_poem": "A sparrow alights on the cracked sidewalk,  \nits wings a whisper, a tremor of light.  \nIt preens the feathers, a quiet ritual,  \nunaware the gaze of a human is tight  \nbeside the fence, where the morning air  \nholds breath like a secret the sky won\u2019t share.  \nThe bird tilts its head, a small, curious act,  \nas if the world were a question it might ask\u2014  \nbut the speaker remains a shadowed pact,  \na stillness that blooms where the wild things pass.  \nThe creature takes flight, a flicker of gray,  \nand the walk remains, a silent stage for the day.",
