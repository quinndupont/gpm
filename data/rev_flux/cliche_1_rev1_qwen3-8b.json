      "critique": "**What\u2019s alive**:  \nThe poem succeeds in framing maternal love as an invisible, gravitational force through concrete details (pillow adjustments, humming, scent of perfume) and contrasts between tangible (blanket\u2019s weight) and intangible (absence as a \u201csilence so precise\u201d). The free verse enjambment mirrors the quiet persistence of the mother\u2019s influence.  \n\n**Issues**:  \n1. **Abstraction**: \u201cStitching the air into something solid\u201d is vague; the metaphor lacks the specificity needed to ground the mother\u2019s presence.  \n2. **Sentimentality**: \u201cThe way the world keeps turning, just as she left it\u201d risks overstatement, echoing clich\u00e9s about continuity.  \n3. **Weak line breaks**: The long sentence about measuring love in \u201cspaces between her departures\u201d could be split for rhythmic clarity.  \n4. **C",
