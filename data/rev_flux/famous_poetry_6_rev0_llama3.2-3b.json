  "final_poem": "America's chorus swells and fades\nEach heartbeat weaving intricate shades\nIn steel mills' throbbing, rhythmic sighs\nA miner's lullaby of weary eyes\n\nBy rail yards' whistling winds that moan\nThe bluesy serenade of a lone\nThe hum of factory floors awake\nAs workers weave their individual ache\n\nTheir songs converge in anthem grand\nEchoing streets where diversity expands\nEach voice an instrument anew\nIn America's ever-changing tune\n\nFrom streetcar bells to lonesome whine\nEach worker sings their path divine\nTogether merging in a chorus wide\nA tapestry of hearts, side by side",
