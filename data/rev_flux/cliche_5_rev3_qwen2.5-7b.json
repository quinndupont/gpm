      "draft": "In the quiet dawn's first light,\nmy father tends his garden\u2019s might.\nWith hands that shape and mold, he crafts\na world where flowers bloom unafraid.\n\nInside our home, a sanctuary,\nhe weaves warmth with every stitch of memory.\nFrom sun-kissed kitchens to beds by night,\nhis presence makes dark shadows take flight.\n\nThrough whispers in the wind, his wisdom speaks,\nlike gentle rain that feeds the earth\u2019s deep sleep.\nHe shows me strength not in grand exploits or might,\nbut by how he holds a child's small hand tight.\n\nIn every leaf that dances with the breeze,\nin every moment of shared laughter and ease\u2014\nhere lies the heart of fatherhood's true test,\nnot in battles fought, but in seeds we plant.\n\nWith hands as soft as petals unfurled,\nhe shapes the day to make it feel world-encircled.\nIn nature\u2019s quiet whispers where he finds his rest,\nI see him strongest, wisest\u2014by my side, forever blessed.",
      "critique": "What works:\n- The imagery of nature and domestic scenes effectively conveys the nurturing and growth themes.\n- The internal rhyme in \"unafraid\" and \"speaks\" adds a natural flow to the poem.\n\nIssues:\n- **Abstraction**: Some lines are abstract and could benefit from more concrete details. For example, line 4 (\"With hands that shape and mold, he crafts\") is somewhat vague.\n- **Weak Line Breaks**: Lines like \"From sun-kissed kitchens to beds by night\" can be split or rearranged for better rhythm and emphasis.\n\nDirections:\n1. **Clarify the imagery in lines 3-4**. Instead of just saying \"he crafts,\" specify what he is crafting, such as \"he crafts a world where flowers bloom unafraid.\"\n2. **Refine line breaks**: Split \"From sun-kissed kitchens to beds by night\" into two lines: \"From sun-kissed kitchens / To beds by night.\" This will help emphasize the transition from day to night.\n3. **Avoid overgeneralization in line 10**. Instead of saying \"his presence makes dark shadows take flight,\" consider something more specific, like \"his laughter chases away the evening's chill.\"\n\nWhen done:\nThis poem has found its shape.",
