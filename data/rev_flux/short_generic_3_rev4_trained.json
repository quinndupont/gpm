      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe radiator line \u2014 \"keeps hitting the wall\" \u2014 is the poem's strongest moment. It does sensory work without announcing itself, and it earns its place by being specific enough to feel like a real object in a real room.\n\n\"The middle one keeps / gathering dust like a name / nobody will call.\" This is precise, quiet, and carries genuine weight. The pillow as something that physically accumulates absence \u2014 that's the poem's central idea rendered well.\n\n\"without reason, without\nsmiling.\" The double negative here creates a small compression of feeling that works. It trusts the line to do its own work.\n\nThe closing image \u2014 \"this quiet was built\" \u2014 has real force because it arrives after building enough physical detail around loss. That final verb \"built\" gives the emptiness architecture, which is strange and right.\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Clich\u00e9 / near-clich\u00e9:** \"February,\" \"window leaks light,\" \"mouth leaks toothpaste.\" The poem's best moments come from objects that have been stripped of easy association \u2014 the radiator, the mattress with opinions, the hinge letting go at 2 AM. February is a greeting-card word here. Direction: cut it or find an image as particular as \"hitting the wall.\"\n\n**Abstraction:** \"The thermostat thinks / we're still here.\" This personification is doing work that belongs to the mattress in a later line (\"the mattress has opinions now\"). The poem repeats itself at the level of idea rather than image. Direction: choose one and cut the other, or better \u2014 make both more physical.\n\n**Sentimentality:** \"Each one votes / for the empty seat.\" This is the poem explaining its own meaning to the reader. It tells us what counting ceiling tiles signifies instead of letting the tiles do that work. Direction: remove this line entirely. Let the image stand without narrating its metaphorical payload.\n\n**Weak line break:** \"without reason, without / smiling.\" The break on \"without\" creates no tension or surprise \u2014 it just splits a phrase. Direction: break after \"reason,\" so \"without reason, without smiling\" lands as two discrete gestures.\n\n**Tonal inconsistency:** The poem opens in stillness and specificity (\"radiator,\" \"middle pillow\"), then drifts into domestic clich\u00e9 (February, toothpaste), then returns to stillness with more success. Direction: tighten the arc \u2014 let the opening images do all the work so no return to generic register is possible.\n\n**\"Easily said\" / dead metaphor:** \"The air tastes like the\ninside of a coat\nleft outside rain.\" This simile is trying",

      "critique": "## Revision Workshop Response\n\n---\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe radiator hitting the wall \u2014 \"keeps banging its one note / against the wall, a struck match held still\" \u2014 is the poem's strongest opening and it stays strong through line 20. That image does what so many poems try to do: it makes silence sound by making us hear something physical.\n\n\"The middle one gone grey,\" in the second pillow stanza, earns its place with texture (\"gone grey\") where others reach for metaphor. The dust accumulating on a name \u2014 that's real and strange without needing explanation.\n\n\"Each empty space a vote / for whatever seat went missing.\" Before this line was cut, it had genuine compression: each ceiling tile becomes a ballot cast for what left. That's the kind of small, quiet logic the poem builds toward in its strongest moments.\n\nThe mattress lines (\"It remembers which side / and leans that way\") are clean and effective \u2014 syntax working as a body does.\n\n---\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Clich\u00e9 / near-clich\u00e9:**\n- \"February\" \u2014 cut entirely\n- \"mouth leaks toothpaste\" \u2014 cut or replace with something stranger, more specific to this particular room/season\n- \"The house was built for two\" (implied in \"whatever seat went missing\") \u2014 cut the abstraction; keep the idea if it lands through image\n\n**Abstraction:**\n- \"this narrow corridor was built / for passages between states.\" This is the poem explaining its own meaning. The hallway-as-corridor phrasing already does this work, so the line after it restates it. Direction: cut or collapse into a single line.\n- \"the name of which direction felt / more like a door than a ceiling\" \u2014 \"more like\" is soft here; make the comparison sharper\n\n**Sentimentality:**\n- \"The air tastes like the inside of a coat / left out in rain.\" This simile collapses under inspection. A coat left outside rains? That's not an image, it's a greeting-card phrase. Direction: find something that actually belongs to this room and this night \u2014 what does a radiator smell like after hours without heat?\n\n**Tonal inconsistency:**\n- The poem opens with objects (\"radiator,\" \"middle pillow\") then drifts into domestic clich\u00e9 (February, toothpaste), then returns to stillness with more success. Direction: tighten the opening \u2014 make it as particular as lines 20\u201335 so no return to generic register is possible.\n\n**Weak line break / syntax:**\n- \"without reason, without / smiling\" \u2014 break after \"reason\"\n- \"I turn and the mattress shifts opinion,\" \u2014 \"shifts opinion\" personifies too lightly; consider stronger phrasing\n- \"a name is easier / said one direction\" \u2014 \"easier\" softens. Direction: sharpen to match the precision of \"gone grey\"\n\n**Redund",
