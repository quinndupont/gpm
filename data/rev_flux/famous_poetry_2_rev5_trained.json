      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe domestic landscape is the poem's real engine, and it works hard: \"the faucet runs in the kitchen,\" \"a kettle fills,\" \"steam curls off the tile, then dissolves.\" These are precise, sensory gestures that *show* absence rather than naming it \u2014 a constant, quiet refusal. The raven itself has genuine texture: standing on one leg behind the mail pile with a look \"the way an attendant might look / at a door they're entrusted to watch.\" That simile earns its place because it does comparison work without announcing itself.\n\nThe turn at line 25 (\"This is not grief\") is well-placed and genuinely surprising \u2014 the poem has been building toward this refusal, so the reader feels the weight of what's *not* being said. The closing image (the cold cup on the table, the ticking kettle) lands because it stays inside the domestic world rather than reaching for abstraction.\n\nThe poem knows how to handle repetition: \"4:17\" arrives once with quiet insistence and never returns as a refrain, which is exactly right \u2014 it escalates through context, not repetition. The word \"dissolves\" at line 5 does double work (steam vanishing, the man watching it vanish), which is craft.\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Sentimentality / Over-explanation (lines 31\u201340):**\nThe passage starting \"This is not grief, he'd tell you if / he could\" collapses into a paraphrase of what the poem has already shown. The domestic gestures *are* the denial \u2014 watching water boil, losing interest after seven minutes, noticing tremors without reaching for anything. These are doing far more than the explanatory prose. Direction: cut or radically compress this section. Trust the kettle and the cold coffee to carry the meaning.\n\n**Clich\u00e9 / Dead language (lines 17\u201320):**\n\"The letterbox in the garden, / the mailbox down the street\" \u2014 this is postcard material. The poem's best domestic images are specific (\"the precise angle at which 4:17 / punctures the day like a nail through cloth\") and this one isn't. Direction: make the delivery route as strange or particular as everything else.\n\n**Abstraction (lines 35\u201336):**\n\"Without feeling anything else.\" \"Something still arrives at four.\" These are the poem *telling* its own meaning to the reader instead of letting silence and image do it. \"The maps inside me went soft\" is a metaphor that flees on contact \u2014 it's vague enough no one can feel it. Direction: replace with another concrete, observed detail. What does this man actually see at 4:17? The poem knows (the raven). Stay there.\n\n**Weak line breaks (lines 8\u20139):**\n\"stands / on one leg behind",

      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe domestic landscape is the poem's real engine, and it works hard: \"the faucet runs in the kitchen,\" \"a kettle fills,\" \"steam curls off the tile, then dissolves.\" These are precise, sensory gestures that *show* absence rather than naming it \u2014 a constant, quiet refusal. The raven itself has genuine texture: standing on one leg behind the mail pile with a look \"the way an attendant might look / at a door they're entrusted to watch.\" That simile earns its place because it does comparison work without announcing itself.\n\nThe turn at line 25 (\"This is not grief, he'd tell you if\nhe could\") is well-placed and genuinely surprising \u2014 the poem has been building toward this refusal, so the reader feels the weight of what's *not* being said. The closing image (the cold cup on the table, the ticking kettle) lands because it stays inside the domestic world rather than reaching for abstraction.\n\nThe poem knows how to handle repetition: \"4:17\" arrives once with quiet insistence and never returns as a refrain, which is exactly right \u2014 it escalates through context, not repetition. The word \"dissolves\" at line 5 does double work (steam vanishing, the man watching it vanish), which is craft.\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Sentimentality / Over-explanation (lines 31\u201340):**\nThe passage starting \"This is not grief, he'd tell you if / he could\" collapses into a paraphrase of what the poem has already shown. The domestic gestures *are* the denial \u2014 watching water boil, losing interest after seven minutes, noticing tremors without reaching for anything. These are doing far more than the explanatory prose. Direction: cut or radically compress this section. Trust the kettle and the cold coffee to carry the meaning.\n\n**Clich\u00e9 / Dead language (lines 17\u201320):**\n\"The letterbox in the garden, / the mailbox down the street\" \u2014 this is postcard material. The poem's best domestic images are specific (\"the precise angle at which 4:17 / punctures the day like a nail through cloth\") and this one isn't. Direction: make the delivery route as strange or particular as everything else.\n\n**Abstraction (lines 35\u201336):**\n\"Without feeling anything else.\" \"Something still arrives at four.\" These are the poem *telling* its own meaning to the reader instead of letting silence and image do it. \"The maps inside me went soft\" is a metaphor that flees on contact \u2014 it's vague enough no one can feel it. Direction: replace with another concrete, observed detail. What does this man actually see at 4:17? The poem knows (the raven). Stay there.\n\n**Weak line breaks (lines 8\u20139",
