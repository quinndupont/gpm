  "final_poem": "# Two Roads, One Choosing\n\nWhere the path forks and the map is thin,\nI stood at altitude, breath on my hands,\nthe creek below still doing what creeks understand\u2014\nrunning right through the place where I happened.\n\nOne trail descended into timber darkened\nby a hundred years of no one's forgetting.\nThe other turned uphill, thin as a question,\nand before me opened into country\n\nwhere the air sat on the land like it owned it,\nwhere a field stretched out without a fence,\nwhere somewhere in that silence a door\nhad once been knocked shut clean enough to frame\n\nthe leaving\u2014arched, domestic, every detail\na kitchen anyone could walk through, later.\nI chose the narrow slope and lost the map.\nI trusted where my foot had already stepped,\n\nand that first step made all others possible,\nnot by overriding what was there but\nby opening thinner corridors for light\u2014\nhow a vein becomes a river's artery.\n\nYears later: the difference showed not in wealth,\nfor both paths widened into ordinary width,\nbut in the way I hung my window open\ntoward whatever arrived without an appointment,\n\nin how I let the afternoon keep me\ninstead of reading what someone said about it.\nThe unlived life, they warn you\u2014oh, the pile\nsomewhere beneath the flower boxes,\n\nbut what I found was simpler: just the habit\nof turning left where any other person\nwould've gone straight. And that small refusal\nhad made a country in my view of things,\n\na kind of keeping-past-doors-open, almost\nsuperstitious, almost unlatching\n\nwhat the body learned to lock.\nI didn't find freedom\u2014freedom is the price\nwe pay for choosing nothing. What I found\nwas more like having hands again after ice.\n\nThe creek below kept going where it must.\nMine kept going too, down different grasses,\nslower, bordered now by stones I set myself,\neach one a small commemoration\n\nof the act of slowing\u2014how the hand\nlearns slower than the mind understands\nthat stopping is not loss but the first\narchitecture, the lime in mortar,\n\nthe thing that holds the choosing open\nso another choice can find its own edge.\nI don't know which road was wrong. I suspect\nboth were right for someone else on them.\n\nWhat I know: the version of me who took left\nbrought back a stone to keep beside my bed,\ntouching it and feeling something like\nthe whole slow weight of what I didn't leave behind.",
