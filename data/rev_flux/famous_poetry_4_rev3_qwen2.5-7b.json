      "draft": "In autumn's grasp, leaves whisper tales,\nA chorus underfoot, as if in hush.\nThe sky a bruise where once blue spread,\nNow clouds like cotton bales drift and rush.\n\nI held my father\u2019s hand beneath the oak\u2014\nIts bark rough, weathered by winter winds.\nHe laughed, his laugh a distant echo now,\nAs seasons turn and time unfurls its binds.\n\nHis breath grows shallow, then still as leaves,\nFalling to earth in silent grace.\nYet memories bloom like flowers on graves:\nWinter gives way; spring's soft green takes place.\n\nIn summer\u2019s heat, I stroll the garden paths\u2014\nA rose entwines with thorns, both vital.\nMy mother watches from her window pane,\nHer eyes a well of sorrow and serenity.\n\nShe speaks to him in hushed, tender tones\u2014\nOf summers past where laughter filled each room.\nHer voice weaves through me like ivy's bonds,\nEncompassing love that neither grows nor looms.\n\nAutumn returns with its crisp air scents\u2014\nCherry pips scattered on wet earth\u2019s skin.\nThe tree creaks under my touch, a mournful sound,\nYet within it, life stirs; the sap flows in.\n\nI plant new bulbs, seeds of what's to come,\nIn faith that spring will find them underground.\nFor every ending is but a beginning, they say\u2014\nA cycle unbroken by any profound.\n\nSo too with love, as winter yields to light:\nMy father\u2019s absence now a bittersweet sight.\nThe garden thrives not in his presence here,\nBut from the depths of memory\u2019s fertile sphere.",
      "critique": "What Works:\n- The imagery of nature and changing seasons effectively symbolizes the passage of time and resilience.\n- The personal narrative provides a strong emotional core, particularly in the interactions with parents.\n\nIssues:\n- **Weak Line Breaks**: Some lines feel too long or could be broken to enhance rhythm and meaning. For example, \"In autumn's grasp, leaves whisper tales,\" could benefit from a break after \"whisper.\"\n- **Clich\u00e9 Phrases**: The phrase \"a bittersweet sight\" is slightly clich\u00e9d.\n- **Overly Abstract Sentences**: Some lines are abstract without clear imagery or sensory detail. For instance, \"time unfurls its binds\" lacks specific imagery.\n\nDirections:\n1. Break the line after \"whisper\" in the first stanza: \"In autumn's grasp, leaves whisper / tales.\"\n2. Replace \"a bittersweet sight\" with something more vivid and personal, such as \"the garden thrives where he once walked.\"\n3. Enhance abstract sentences by adding specific imagery. For example, change \"time unfurls its binds\" to \"time weaves through the oak's gnarled bark.\"\n\nWhen done:\nThis poem has found its shape.",
