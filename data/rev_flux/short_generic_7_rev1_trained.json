      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe central conceit \u2014 silence as something that *does* things, rather than just being empty absence \u2014 is genuinely strong and worth building a whole poem around. The fan in lines 1\u20134 has real energy: \"memorized their own rotation\" gives it a brain; \"just / the hum that leans into stillness like a posture\" earns its abstraction by anchoring it physically. That image sets up what follows with some trust.\n\nThe sump pump passage (lines 37\u201342) is the poem's strongest sustained stretch. \"Not to anything, exactly, but to the weight / of ground and how weight / arranges itself when no one is adjusting it\" \u2014 this has genuine philosophical precision without losing its body. The idea that silence listens *to weight* rather than sound is specific enough to hold.\n\nThe closing image (lines 62\u201367) also works: \"a room would stop being so good / at keeping things the way they are.\" It earns its abstraction because it's preceded by concrete machinery, and the verb \"keeping\" does real work \u2014 it suggests containment without saying so. That line has compression.\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Rhyme as structural crutch (lines 1\u20138).** The rhyme scheme is driving the poem in lines 1\u20138 far more than the logic of silence and objects requires. \"Rotation\" / \"click,\" \"them\u2014just\" / \"posture\" \u2014 these are filling a template rather than serving meaning. The fan stanza is the one place where the domestic, overlooked imagery matches the abstraction well *without* rhyme. Direction: **strip lines 1\u20138 of their rhyme entirely and rebuild from silence's action.** If you want to return to a scheme, do so only after the poem has found its shape in plain speech.\n\n**Clich\u00e9 proximity (line 7).** \"Keeps its evidence\" is close enough to stock phrasing that it weakens the kitchen glass image. Direction: **replace with something more material \u2014 what does the glass actually *do* with the light? Store it, reflect it, erase it?***\n\n**Abstraction without anchor (lines 17\u201320).** \"The door performs its parable of release / by letting go entirely\" \u2014 this is abstraction explaining itself. The hinge click and metal memory in lines 45\u201348 are stronger precisely because they stay physical. Direction: **cut the explanation, let the action stand alone.**\n\n**Tonal inconsistency (lines 32\u201337).** \"The spoon in water has been drawing pictures / nobody will see\" shifts into whimsy that doesn't quite land with the gravity of what follows. The sump pump passage returns to something earned. Direction: **the poem's register needs to stay in the same weight-class from start to finish.",
