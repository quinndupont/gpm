      "critique": "### What Works:\n- The celestial imagery and metaphor are well-developed, creating a strong contrast between the constancy of the stars and the fleeting nature of summer.\n- The sonnet form is effectively used to structure the poem, providing a framework that supports both transient and enduring elements.\n\n### Issues:\n1. **Rhyme Scheme:**\n   - **Deviation from Form:** The detected rhyme scheme does not match the expected ABAB pattern for a Shakespearean sonnet. Lines 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, and 5 do not follow the required rhymes.\n   - **Direction:** Revise the rhyme words to ensure they fit the ABAB scheme. For example:\n     - \"hour\" (line 2) should rhyme with \"power\" (line 4)\n     - \"shine\" (line 1) should rhyme with \"renew\" (line 6)\n\n2. **Meter:**\n   - While iambic pentameter is generally maintained, there are some variations that could be smoothed out.\n   - **Direction:** Ensure consistent meter by revising lines to fit the iambic pattern more precisely. For example:\n     - Line 1: \"In skies where constellations steadfast shine\" (current) \u2192 \"In skies where constellations steady shine\"\n     - Line 2: \"A fleeting star, its light but for an hour\" (current) \u2192 \"A fleeting star, its light but in an hour\"\n\n3. **Imagery and Metaphor:**\n   - The imagery is strong, but some lines could be more vivid.\n   - **Direction:** Enhance the celestial imagery to make it even more evocative. For example:\n     - Line 10: \"Neptune whispers from his distant shore\" \u2192 \"Neptune murmurs from his vast expanse\"\n\n4. **Line Breaks and Flow:**\n   - The line breaks could be adjusted for better flow and emphasis.\n   - **Direction:** Consider breaking lines to emphasize certain words or phrases, such as:\n     - Line 12: \"Their presence unimpaired though summer wanes\" \u2192 \"Their presence unimpaired / Though summer wanes\"\n\n### Workshop Response:\n\nThe poem is rich in celestial imagery and effectively contrasts the constancy of stars with the fleeting nature of a summer day. However, there are several areas that need refinement to ensure it adheres to the sonnet form and enhances its poetic quality.\n\nFirstly, address the rhyme scheme by revising lines 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, and 5 to fit the ABAB pattern. For example:\n- Line 4: \"power\" should rhyme with \"shine\"\n- Line 6: \"renew\" should rhyme with \"shine\"\n\nSecondly, ensure consistent i",
