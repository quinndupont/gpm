      "draft": "When you said *my love is stronger than summer*\nI didn't answer because I couldn't hear\nthe heat strip hiss from the air, couldn't feel\nhow a day's best work \u2014 the blue, the buzz of bees,\nthe rustling nothingness of ten thousand leaves \u2014\n\nslipped through its own fingers like a name\nyou've said so often it has worn into\nthe silence behind speech. I watched you.\nYour face went clean. Not empty exactly\u2014\nthe way a window holds no picture\nafter the glass is cleared.\n\nThere's a layer beneath even summer.\nNot absence. Something that carries temperature,\nthat vibrates with the frequency of being\nbefore it became the kind of thing\nwe name and eat, sit under, breathe out smoke from.\n\nI've been thinking about the infrared image\nof a field mid-June: how the software\nfills in every living pixel with heat,\nthe wheat turning into a faint red glow,\nthe road a brighter blush because it surfaces\nwhat the eye already suspects\u2014\nthat below the green there is no mass,\nno substance holding shape, just the push\nof radiation pressing outward from\nthe molecules' failing agreement to be\nstiff and anchored.\n\nAnd you were right. My love wasn't stronger.\nIt was more specific. It existed\nin the way a surface gives up its warmth\nafter dark, in how the grass still registers\nfootprint depressions an hour after rain\u2014\nnot because it remembers but because\nthe earth is slower than the need to leave.\n\nWhat endures isn't the peak. The peak\nis just the moment where the sun catches\neverything at once and all attention\ndissolves into the ordinary business\nof light leaving surfaces. What stays\nis what the infrared sees: the faint glow,\nthe after-body, the field giving back\nwhat it borrowed so thoroughly\nit almost became summer's thing.\n\nI didn't answer you because I wanted\nto stay inside that cooler country\u2014\nnot grief, not anything like mourning yet,\nbut the principle of it: whatever love\nsurvives isn't a second peak.\nIt's the ground effect. The way air\nstill moves across a parking lot\nan hour after the last car leaves.",
      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe closing image \u2014 \"the way air still moves across a parking lot / an hour after the last car leaves\" \u2014 is the poem's real discovery. It's concrete, strange, and earns its weight because it arrives late. The infrared section (lines 23\u201334) also does genuine work: the idea that heat is rendered visible only when a surface has been disturbed enough to betray \"what the eye already suspects\" has real tension. The poem is most alive in its resistance to saying love lasts; instead, it builds toward something colder and stranger.\n\nThe line \"the way a window holds no picture / after the glass is cleared\" \u2014 before revision introduced filler \u2014 had an exactness that works: transparency where there once was figuration. That's close to what the closing image does better.\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Abstraction bloat (lines 1\u201316).** The poem starts by trying *to avoid clich\u00e9* and instead fills those spaces with abstraction piled on abstraction \u2014 \"entropy,\" \"sensory input becoming noise,\" \"static,\" \"radiation, temperature, vibration.\" These are concepts, not images. The opening quotation (\"my love is stronger than summer\") is a premise; the first 16 lines are almost entirely thesis statements about what follows. **Direction:** Cut or radically compress the opening explanation. Let the infrared section and the parking lot image do the philosophical work \u2014 they're more precise *and* more accessible.\n\n**Clich\u00e9 intrusion (lines 20\u201323).** \"The wheat turning into a faint red glow, / the road a brighter blush because it surfaces / what the eye already suspects\" \u2014 this is landscape painting with stock effects. \"Faint red glow,\" \"brighter blush,\" \"the push / of radiation pressing outward\" are all decorative. **Direction:** Replace with something only *this* infrared image would see. What does heat do to a field at 2:00 AM that's not in any calendar post?\n\n**Excessive explanation (throughout).** The poem narrates its own argument rather than trusting the images to carry weight. \"Not absence. Something that carries temperature\" \u2014 this is the poet *telling* what the reader could discover. \"The peak is just the moment where the sun catches / everything at once and all attention / dissolves into the ordinary business / of light leaving surfaces.\" This explains away the very mystery the closing image was reaching toward. **Direction:** Every time the poem says \"this means\" or \"the conclusion is,\" cut that clause entirely. Let the image hold its own weight.\n\n**Line breaks (lines 13\u201320).** \"Not empty exactly\u2014 / the way a window holds no picture / after the glass is cleared.\" \u2014 \"exactly\u2014\" is filler, and \"after the glass is cleared\" is vague",
