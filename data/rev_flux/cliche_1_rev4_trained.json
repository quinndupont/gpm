      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### What's Alive\n\nThe refrigerator moment \u2014 \"the refrigerator's / exhalation, cold / pressing against her ribs like / it has somewhere to be\" \u2014 is the poem's strongest move. That verb *somewhere* does real work: it humanizes an appliance without explaining itself. The image earns its strangeness.\n\n\"She finds the cup already\nfilled, the way she fills things\u2014\nwithout asking.\"\n\nThe em-dash here creates a small hesitation that mirrors the mother's automatic gesture before she notices her own hands. That's precise craft.\n\n\"Her hands / not so steady as she thinks.\"\n\nThis is honest and understated \u2014 the poem is doing more by staying quiet than it does anywhere else.\n\n### What Isn't Working\n\n**Abstraction (lines 13\u201314):** \"it has somewhere to be\" \u2014 while the image itself works, the explanation through the following line weakens both. The cold refrigerator pressing against ribs is already strange and tender; the poem doesn't need to name that strangeness *again*. Direction: cut or radically compress lines 13\u201314. Let the image stand alone with its ambiguity.\n\n**Weak closure (line 16):** \"like / it has somewhere to be\" \u2014 the trailing slash creates visual emphasis the language doesn't earn. The line break here is doing nothing that a period wouldn't do, and it slightly flattens the ending. Direction: end the line at a comma or semicolon. Or better, find a final image that closes without explaining.\n\n**Tonal flatness (lines 5\u20138):** \"Dawn barely / arrives. The counter\nholds its breath:\na tangerine, a knife\nstill drawn through orange.\"\n\nThis is decorative still-life. It doesn't serve the central drama \u2014 the mother failing. \"Holds its breath\" is personification that softens what should be sharpening. Direction: either make this imagery *do* something for the mother (what does the silence in the kitchen do to her hands, her chest?) or cut it entirely and find a single image closer to the refrigerator moment.\n\n**Line count:** The poem is 16 lines but doesn't fully occupy its space. Several lines \u2014 8, 9, 10, 13\u201314 \u2014 are doing one thing (explaining) rather than trusting the images. Direction: revise toward 12\u201314 lines where every line advances the scene or the feeling.\n\n### Revision\n\nHere's a revised opening that stays closer to the kitchen image but earns its tenderness through action:\n\n---\n\nShe finds the cup already\nfilled, the way she fills things\u2014\nwithout asking.\n\nDawn barely\narrives.

      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\nThe revision is stronger, but the poem still hasn't found its shape. Here's why.\n\n---\n\n### What's Alive\n\n**Line 12: \"on the\" \u2014 that trailing preposition.**\nThis is the most alive moment in the entire draft. It forces a stumble in syntax and enacts the mother's off-balance physical reality at the same time she's trying to recover composure. The line break after it lets silence do more work than any explanation could.\n\n**The refrigerator image (lines 13\u201314):**\n\"the refrigerator's / exhalation, cold\npressing against her ribs like\nit has somewhere to be.\"\nThe verb *somewhere* is genuinely surprising and earned by the context. The cold air of a fridge pressing outward \u2014 that's not decorative; it's precise sensory observation.\n\n**The em-dash in line 2:**\n\"without asking.\" \u2014 creates a small hesitation that mirrors the mother's automatic gesture before she notices her own hands. That's craft, not decoration.\n\n---\n\n### What Isn't Working\n\n**Tonal flatness / weak accumulation (lines 5\u20138):**\n\"The counter\nholds its breath:\na tangerine,\na knife\nstill drawn through orange skin.\"\nThis is still-life cataloguing. Each object gets a line but none of them *do* anything for the mother's experience in this draft. \"Holds its breath\" is personification that softens what should be sharpening. Direction: cut or compress. One image doing work \u2014 not three sitting inert.\n\n**Line 9:**\n\"Her hands / not so steady as she thinks.\"\nThis tells us about steadiness *after* the glass has already been set down wrong (lines 10\u201312). The sequence is reversed from how it should land in a poem that trusts its images. Direction: move this closer to or inside lines 8\u20139, so the reader sees the hands waver before they see the glass set down.\n\n**Line 14:**\n\"like / it has somewhere to be.\"\nThe trailing slash creates visual emphasis the language doesn't earn. The line break here is doing nothing that a period wouldn't do, and it slightly flattens the ending. Direction: end the line at a comma or semicolon. Or better, find a final image that closes without explaining.\n\n**Line 12:**\n\"on the\"\n\u2014 that trailing preposition again. It's doing real physical work (the glass skidding on something soft), but \"on the\" is vague where \"on the edge of the fridge\" was precise. Direction: name what surface more specifically \u2014 the poem gains nothing from vagueness here.\n\n**Line 15:**\n\"cold\npressing against her ribs\"\n\u2014 the line break after *cold* creates a tonal flatness that doesn't serve the strangeness of the image.

Here's the breakdown.\n\n---\n\n### What's Alive (from both drafts)\n\n**Line 12: \"shake / shake\" \u2014 the enjambment here is doing real physical work.**\nThe repetition and the trailing preposition (\"shake enough to list the glass off-center, off-the fridge where it\") create a stumble that mirrors the mother's own instability. This line knows what it wants.\n\n**Line 14: \"like / it has somewhere to be.\" \u2014 the em-dash in the previous draft survives here and still works.**\nThe verb *somewhere* is genuinely surprising; it earns its strangeness by context. The cold air acting like something with a destination \u2014 that's precise sensory observation, not decoration.\n\n**Line 12 (revision): \"shake / shake\" \u2014 same note.**\nThe trailing preposition creates the stumble. This line trusts the body more than line 9 of the previous draft (\"Her hands / not so steady as she thinks\").\n\n---\n\n### What Isn't Working\n\n**Tonal flatness across lines 5\u20138:**\n\"The counter\nholds its breath:\na tangerine,\na knife\nstill drawn through orange skin.\"\nEach object gets a line, but none of them *do* anything for the mother's experience. \"Holds its breath\" is personification that softens what should be sharpening. Direction: cut or compress to one image doing work \u2014 not three inert ones.\n\n**Line 9 (revision):**\n\"Her hands / are not so steady\"\n\u2014 this tells steadiness *after* the glass has already been set down wrong (lines 10\u201312). The sequence is reversed from how it should land in a poem that trusts its images.

This line trusts the body more than earlier drafts.\n\n**Line 8 (revision): \"off-center, off-\" \u2014 the ellipsis earns its place by letting silence do what the poem can't name directly.**\nThis is the most alive moment in the revision: something happens before the speaker names it.\n\n**Line 12: \"not steady, / not quite still\" \u2014 the double negation without explanation lands with weight.**\nThe glass refusing to be fixed gives the final image genuine resistance against summary.\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Line 5 (revision): \"a blade still red\"\n\u2014 this is decorative detail.**\nIt doesn't serve the mother's experience; it delays what should arrive sooner. Direction: cut or make its presence do sensory work \u2014 blood on what?\n\n**Line 7: \"wets cold skin\" \u2014 vague and inert.**\nThe knife slicing orange into cold water is an image, but *wets* is a verb that softens rather than sharpens. Direction: replace with something the body registers more directly.\n\n**Line 8 (revision): \"off-center\"\n\u2014 stated, not shown.**\nThe poem already enacts this in the glass hopping; naming it flattens the action. Direction: cut or compress \u2014 let the glass falling off-center do its own work.\n\n**Line 10: \"a small country\" \u2014 metaphor that explains rather than reveals.**\n\"Cathedral of ice\" also names what should be felt. Direction: replace both with concrete sensory detail \u2014 what does frost actually look like on a kitchen sill at dawn?\n\n**Line 9 (revision): \"She sets down wrong.\" \u2014 telling after the action.**\nThe poem's strength is in showing; this line narrates. Direction: cut or make it part of the enjambment so the reader sees the wrongness.\n\n**Line 12 (revision): \"on the\" \u2014 vague, generic.**\nDirection: name what surface with precision \u2014 the edge of a counter, a lip, something specific.\n\n**Line 13: \"the air finds her.\" \u2014 personification that softens.**\nThe cold moving across skin is already visible; the verb *finds* makes it narrative. Direction: cut or make intransigent \u2014 let the air arrive without agency.\n\n**Line 15 (revision): \"cold\npressing against her ribs\" \u2014 line break after \"cold\" creates flatness.**\nThe word needs company to land harder.
