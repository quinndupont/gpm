      "critique": "What's Alive:\n- The poem effectively captures the essence of true love through mundane, everyday activities.\n- The imagery of shared meals and walks in the park provides a tangible sense of their bond.\n- The consistent free verse structure mirrors the rhythm of their daily lives.\n\nIssues (Type, Location, Direction):\n- **Abstraction**: Lines like \"no need for far-off dreams or plans\" are somewhat abstract. Consider grounding these ideas with specific examples from their routine to make them more concrete and relatable.\n  - Example: Instead of \"far-off dreams,\" mention a particular dream they once shared that now seems distant.\n\n- **Weak Line Breaks**: Some line breaks do not enhance the meaning but disrupt the flow, particularly in lines like:\n  - \"Ripe red, crisp gold\u2014each a moment captured\" (consider breaking this into two lines: \"Ripe red, crisp gold. Each a moment captured.\")\n  - \"Their steps sync to the pace of twilight's breath.\" (break after \"twilight\": \"Their steps sync to the / pace of twilight\u2019s breath.\")\n\n- **Sentimentality**: The line \"In each other\u2019s company, no need for far-off dreams or plans\" leans towards sentimentality. Try to maintain a more understated tone.\n  - Example: Replace with something like \"In each other's company, their love is here, in the everyday.\"\n\nWhen Done:\nThis poem has found its shape.",
