      "draft": "In the quiet crinkle of autumn leaves,\nthe wind whispers through an old, familiar park.\nHere, under bare branches heavy with thought,\nI walk in footsteps laid by seasons past.\n\nEach leaf, a memory\u2014tender and crisp:\nof hands clasped where acorns promised spring;\nand laughter that still chills when it rises from the ground\nbeneath our feet. The air is cooler now.\n\nA chill seeps into skin once warm with summer,\nas I linger in spots we used to find.\nThe maple's cloak has loosened, its glory stripped away\u2014\nbut on each scarlet page of this fall, our story shines bright still.\n\nNot like a fleeting sun or endless spring;\nnot like the days when warmth seemed never-ending.\nBut here\u2014a memory that clings through change,\nlike fallen leaves that whisper to the ground.",
      "critique": "What Works:\n- The imagery of autumn leaves effectively symbolizes the enduring impact of the relationship.\n- The structure of enjambment creates a flowing, natural rhythm that mirrors the evolving emotions.\n\nIssues:\n- **Abstraction**: The poem could benefit from more specific details and actions to ground the abstract concepts.\n- **Weak Line Breaks**: Some line breaks do not enhance the meaning or flow. For instance, \"of hands clasped where acorns promised spring\" could be improved by breaking it differently.\n- **Sentimentality**: There is a tendency towards overly sentimental language that can detract from the emotional impact.\n\nDirections:\n1. **Specific Details and Actions**:\n   - Replace abstract phrases like \"seasons past\" with more concrete memories, such as \"the swing where we used to laugh.\"\n   - Use specific actions instead of general sentiments: \"We traced our fingers over acorns that hinted at spring.\"\n\n2. **Refine Line Breaks**:\n   - Experiment with line breaks to emphasize key words and phrases. For example, try breaking the line after \"spring\" in the third stanza.\n   - Consider breaking lines where you can create pauses for emphasis: \"The air is cooler now / as I linger in spots we used to find.\"\n\n3. **Subtlety Over Sentimentality**:\n   - Avoid overly emotional language like \"chilled when it rises from the ground.\" Instead, focus on subtle shifts in atmosphere.\n   - Use imagery and action to convey emotions rather than stating them directly.\n\nWhen these changes are implemented:\n\nThis poem has found its shape.",
