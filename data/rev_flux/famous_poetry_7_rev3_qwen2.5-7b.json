      "draft": "In the city's hollow hum,\nWhere glass mirrors clouded skies,  \nA soul wanders, where shadows loom,\nThrough alleyways that whisper wise.  \n\nAt street corners, neon glows and flicker\u2014  \nSigns of futures fleeting, half-glimpsed,\nWhile unseen paths lie under concrete slick\u2014\nPromises cradled in the night's dense.\n\nEchoes of steps lost, a single mind\u2019s march, \nIn the heart that dreams while logic stalks.\nThe road untaken, where silence arches,\nA labyrinth of what might be found in mocks.  \n\nThrough the hum, through the neon din,\nA path whispers softly\u2014what was and could\u2019ve been.\nSilent calls to unseen cities spun\nFrom dreams that slip beyond the skin.\n\nIn this maze of mirrors, choices unmade,\nThe road not taken is where hearts abide,\nUntouched by light or cold embrace\u2014  \nA silent journey within the night's hide.",
      "critique": "What's alive:\n- The urban setting and contrasts between seen and unseen elements create a vivid, reflective atmosphere.\n- The internal rhyme in \"flicker\u2014/ Signs of futures fleeting\" adds to the poem\u2019s sense of reflection.\n\nIssues (type, location, direction):\n- **Abstraction**: Lines like \"A labyrinth of what might be found in mocks\" are abstract and could benefit from more concrete imagery. \n  - Consider replacing \"mocks\" with something more tangible that reflects the urban setting or internal journey.\n  \n- **Weak Line Breaks**: Some lines feel too long, making it harder to parse the meaning and rhythm.\n  - Try breaking lines where there is a shift in thought or sensory detail, such as after \"Promises cradled in the night's dense.\"\n\n- **Sentimentality**: The line \"A path whispers softly\u2014what was and could\u2019ve been\" leans into sentimentality.\n  - Consider a more direct or subtle approach to convey the same idea.\n\nDirections:\n- Replace \"mocks\" with something like \"shadows\" to maintain the urban setting: \"A labyrinth of what might be found in shadows.\"\n- Break line 9 after \"flicker\u2014\": \n  ```\n  At street corners, neon glows and flicker\u2014\n  Signs of futures fleeting, half-glimpsed,\n  ```\n- Refine \"Echoes of steps lost, a single mind\u2019s march\" to something more direct:\n  ```\n  Echoes of footsteps lost, a solitary mind's journey,\n  ```\n\n- Consider revising the line about choices unmade for clarity and impact:\n  ```\n  In this maze of mirrors, choices left undone,\n  The road not taken is where hearts abide,\n  ```\n\nWhen these changes are made, this poem has found its shape.",
