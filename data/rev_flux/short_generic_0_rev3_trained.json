      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe central conceit \u2014 rain as a force that erodes memory through physical, embodied experience \u2014 is genuinely strong and earns its weight. The passage beginning \"I tasted iron\" has real momentum: the shift from external landscape to bodily sensation to geological metaphor (water in rock) to the final image of wet palms with nothing kept inside. That ending does genuine work.\n\nThe siren passage (\"went up a pitch, then down\") is concise and earns its place \u2014 it's one sound selected for texture rather than atmosphere.\n\n\"Like water / finding the exact shape of a stone\" \u2014 this line has compression that rewards close reading. The image does specific physical labor without explanation.\n\nThe closing image (hands held apart with wet palms) is quiet, earned by what came before, and trusts the reader to feel emptiness without naming it.\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Clich\u00e9 intrusion \u2014 \"line 16\"**\n> My fingers traced the grooves between products / the way water finds the fractures in rock,\n>\n> **Direction:** The geological metaphor here is doing what the siren and the dog bark later do: explaining itself through abstraction. Cut or replace with a concrete, sensory gesture. What does the hand actually *do*? Trace? Map? The verb \"traced\" already implies pattern \u2014 find a verb that resists meaning before it arrives.\n\n**Abstraction bloat \u2014 lines 14\u201320**\n> Somewhere a siren went up a pitch, then down.\n>\n> The shelves held everything except the name\n> of what I'd come for \u2014 glycerin, perhaps,\n> or the word for glycerin in another language.\n>\n> My fingers traced the grooves between products\n> the way water finds the fractures in rock,\n> following the soft lines until the surface\n> becomes something else.

Lines 15\u201320 are three separate images stacked as one \u2014 the shelves, the fingers tracing, the woman with children. Choose *one*. Each of those gestures toward abstraction (the missing name, the foreign word for glycerin, the metaphorical book) and the poem loses specificity at exactly the moment it should be most grounded.

What's Alive\n\nThe closing image \u2014 \"I held my hands apart and the palms / were wet with nothing I was keeping from\" \u2014 is the poem's strongest moment.

The fingers tracing water-in-rock passage is already doing geological work \u2014 cut or collapse to find the single gesture that most closely resembles how memory actually *feels* under rain's pressure.\n\n**Redundancy / retelling \u2014 lines 27\u201331**\n> I tasted iron.\n> I tasted the inside\n> of a gate somewhere, rust collected\n> in the teeth of someone who'd left them\n> open all summer while rain did its work \u2014\n> not destruction but the opposite:\n> how a surface can remember every atom\n> it ever lost.\n\nThis passage restates what was already said more concretely earlier. **Direction:** Cut or compress. The dog-bark ending is closer in quality and brevity, so the poem should move toward that model: one image per sentence, no explanation, no accumulation of abstract meaning.\n\n**\"The gap between my teeth\" \u2014 line 1**\n> After the downpour there was a gap\n",

It doesn't earn the reader's attention. **Direction:** Replace with a sensory detail specific only *this* scene has.\n\n**Sentimentality \u2014 \"I heard my own breathing / from outside a different body\" (lines 31\u20132)**\nThe self-as-external-object trick is doing emotional work it doesn't need to do, and the line break after \"different body\" creates slack where tension lives. **Direction:** Either sharpen this moment with a concrete sensory detail that *makes* the strangeness felt, or cut \u2014 because right now it's telling the reader about altered consciousness rather than rendering it.\n\n**Weak transition \u2014 \"The rain didn't change anything permanent.\" (line 36)**\nThis is the poem's thesis statement.

      "draft": "After the downpour there was a gap\nbetween my teeth. I swallowed and it\nwas still there \u2014 that crescent, the thing\nI'd carried all week inside my mouth.\n\nUnder an awning pharmacy, rain\non someone else's hat, on plastic bags.\nSiren up then down. Shelves held\nrubbing alcohol, bandages, a pack\nof cigarettes I could not bear to touch.\n\nA woman at the counter with two boys.\nThey pressed their faces into her shoulders,\nshe held them open like a book\nturned to the wrong page \u2014 that thinning,\nthat clouding, where you read what came before\nin someone else's script, almost legible,\n\ntongue tasted iron, gate I'd left all summer,\nnot destruction but how surface remembers\nevery atom it ever lost. Under my tongue,\nwhere salt dissolves, a phrase I couldn't retrieve \u2014\na name, a town, the color of a jacket\nI wore until rain made it part of me.\n\nFabric stretched across metal offered no protection.\nWind could tear it down at any time.\n\nAfter a while I walked back onto wet concrete,\nwet sidewalk, slowing bus, one barking dog\n\ncleanly,\nlike a word you'd forgotten\nthe meaning of just after saying it.\n\nMy hands had gone grainy \u2014 not holding anything.",
