  "final_poem": "The earth exhales in whispers soft,  \nA thawing hush where frost once slept.  \nThe brook, unbound, its laughter coughs  \nThrough reeds that bend in morning light.  \n\nDaffodils in golden swarms  \nUnfurl their faces to the sun,  \nWhile cherry blossoms, pink and warm,  \nDrift down like snow on silent horns.  \n\nThe bees hum hymns to clover\u2019s tune,  \nAnd butterflies, in zigzag flight,  \nDisturb the breeze with wings so soon  \nTo brush the petals of the night.  \n\nThe sky unbuttons its gray coat,  \nAnd sunbeams spill through branches bare,  \nA quilt of green where shadows float,  \nAnd every root begins to dare.  \n\nThe world, a page turned fresh and bare,  \nNow cradles hope in every stem\u2014  \nA season\u2019s promise, sweet and rare,  \nTo bloom, to break, to wake, to dream.",
