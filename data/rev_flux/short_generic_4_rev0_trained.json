  "final_poem": "# The Shape of What I Knew\n\nThere was a shape my grandmother's hands could make\u2014\nnot dough but the particular way she held her coffee cup,\nthumb resting on the rim, white-gold ring pressing\ninto skin. I didn't name it then. I named it\nonly later, sitting in a library reading about objects\nand their meanings, and there was nothing listed under *ring*\nbut I remembered\u2014the way she'd tilt her head,\nthe window steam-fogged, the radio playing something\nshe wasn't listening to.\n\nI tried to describe this to my cousin once.\nSaid *like a gesture only memory keeps*. He waved his hand\u2014\na loose flourish, nothing held. And I understood:\nyou can't pass it back. You can point at what remains\non a plate in someone else's kitchen, the ghost\nof coffee ring drying there, but that's not the thing itself.\n\nThe thing lives inside who she was.\n\nI find myself reaching for her cup when it's empty,\nrunning my thumb along where the handle meets the mug,\ntaking inventory. That particular wear,\nthat soft dent\u2014after years I could tell you which hand\nmade it, which morning, whether rain had been in the air.\n\nMemory doesn't store things. It stores wanting.\nThe wanting is what gets passed down, crisper\nthan any photograph, more precise than any recollection\nof what was said. It's knowing how to hold\nyourself in a kitchen at five, waiting\nwhile someone pours.\n\nI will keep doing this\u2014reaching, running my thumb,\ntaking inventory. That's the smallest kind of faith I have:\nthat a body properly positioned can still\nhear a kettle from another room,\ncan still turn toward it, pour, and say *here*,\nmeaning exactly what that word meant\nthe thirty-seven times I heard her use it.",
