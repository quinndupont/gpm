What's Alive\n\nThe central conceit \u2014 that a choice is registered not in the walker's departure but in the persistence of their wet footprint, which becomes an ecosystem for moss and salamanders \u2014 is genuinely original. The poem earns its argument through specific sensory detail: \"the way water / holds a thumbprint after the hand,\" \"a crease a microclimate,\" \"mud remembered those exact dimensions.\" These are images that belong only to this poem.\n\nThe line \"it is not a path. It is the story\" \u2014 that's a real pivot, and it arrives with enough distance from clich\u00e9 (\"fork in the road\") that it lands.\n\nThe closing four lines do the most interesting work: \"the landscape's / only reason for staying wet.\" That deflation does what the rest of the poem has been building toward. The world doesn't care about meaning; it just sits there wet. That's a powerful reversal, and it arrives with restraint.\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Clich\u00e9: \"a thumbprint after the hand\" (line 9).** This is the poem reaching for its own best line and then immediately diluting it by echoing it in almost identical terms later (\"the way water / holds a shape\"). The second instance of this metaphor \u2014 \"each heel a proposition it did not reject\" \u2014 is weaker because it's abstracted from the physical. Direction: Cut or radically rework either instance. The poem doesn't need to say \"thumbprint\" twice, especially when once would do.\n\n**Abstraction creeping in (lines 13\u201316).** \"Moss moved in / not by accident but by strategy \u2014 / the crease a microclimate.\" Strategy is an abstraction dressed as agency. This is where the poem stops trusting its own argument and starts explaining it. Direction: Stay with the physical. What does moss actually do at a footprint? Root depth, pH change, moisture gradient. Name those.\n\n**Sentimentality / explanatory note (lines 17\u201320).** \"A name / we will never learn for any creature\" \u2014 this is the poet narrating their own meaning back to the reader. The poem has already shown us that no single animal claims the footprint; it's a place where many small things live together. Telling the reader \"it's complicated\" is the opposite of earning complexity. Direction: Cut entirely or replace with observed detail.\n\n**Weak line break (line 12).** \"the way water / holds a shape\" \u2014 breaking on \"a\" is doing nothing that enjambment can't do elsewhere more cleanly. Direction: Try breaking on \"shape\" instead, or find a shorter line before it so the break carries tension.\n\n**Tonal flatness in the middle.** Lines 13\u201320 read at a constant low pitch \u2014 moss, microclimate, creatures, landscape",
