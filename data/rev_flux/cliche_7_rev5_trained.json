The closing image of light finding the lip of a bowl is precise and earns its weight; it does what the poem has been building toward. The detail of keeping a coffee cup on the counter since October (and never returning to it) is sharp, specific, and carries real emotional charge without explaining itself.\n\nThe line \"I fall into your quiet\" works because it's concrete\u2014quiet as something physically absorbent, like sand or snow. That verb *falls* does double duty: sinking in and being received.\n\nThe stairwell light hitting the banister at 3:26 AM is a real sensory moment. It's particular enough to feel observed rather than invented.\n\n### What Isn't Working\n\n**Sentimentality / Over-explanation (lines 15\u201318):**\n\"Neither of us says *carrying.* Neither of us corrects the thermostat on Thanksgiving.\" \u2014 This paragraph collapses what was accumulating into a neat summary. The poem is better off trusting its own images than narrating them. \"Carrying\" in quotation marks, then the thermostat, then the dog: three things that all mean the same thing. Direction: cut or replace with one more observed detail\u2014something as specific as the coffee cup.\n\n**Abstraction (line 13):**\n\"how I can hear / the difference in your voice when you call / from a hospital lobby and already know\" \u2014 \"already know\" tells the reader what to feel before they've been prepared. The preceding image of the stairwell light was doing this work more quietly. Direction: remove \"and already know.\" Let the recognition be implicit, or find another sensory detail that *enacts* the knowing.\n\n**Clich\u00e9 (line 12):**\n\"the difference in your voice when you call / from a hospital lobby\" \u2014 This reads like a greeting card line nested inside the poem. It's not earning its place next to \"a coffee cup on the counter.\" Direction: replace with something as particular as the stairwell light or the banister.\n\n**Weak transition (line 10):**\n\"I keep a coffee cup on the counter / since October. You never come back to it.\" \u2014 The \"since October\" is filler, a way to pad into the next image. It tells when without reason. Direction: cut the date; let the action speak for duration.\n\n**Redundancy (lines 19\u201324):**\nThe drawer of spoons, method, and the slow fill of water into the bowl repeats \"organized\" and \"method\" from earlier.

The poem has a single, narrow room to inhabit: the hallway between two bedrooms, the stairwell at 3:26 AM, the coffee mug on the counter since October, the light hitting banister, the voice dropping in the hospital lobby line. These are all specific and earned through observation.\n\nThe closing image of water remembering what it was before becoming a room\u2014this is genuinely strong. It does the work of friendship without naming \"friendship.\" The light finding the lip of the bowl is precise and quiet.\n\nLine 13, \"I keep track of that way other than anything,\" has real power because it's vague enough to avoid summary, specific enough to land on its own.\n\nThe dog sleeping between us\u2014still in.

The dog sleeps between us.\" \u2014 This is where the poem explains itself, and it loses what it was gaining. \"Carrying\" in quotes, then the thermostat, then the dog\u2014three things that all mean the same thing without deepening any of them. Direction: choose one image here. Cut two.\n\n**Line 12 (new):**\n\"Your voice drops its pitch by half\u2014a hinge / rotted in the mechanism,\" \u2014 \"a hinge rotted in the mechanism, something / we'll replace only if it stops turning entirely.\" This is a metaphor that explains itself through nested clauses. The hinge image works; the explanation dilutes it. Direction: cut to \"Your voice drops its pitch by half\u2014like a door on old tracks.\"\n\n**Line 19\u201324 (redundancy):**\nThe drawer of spoons, method, and slow fill into bowl is redundant with earlier material.

      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n---\n\n### What's Alive\n\nThe closing image\u2014light finding the lip of a bowl, water remembering what it was before becoming room\u2014is genuinely strong. It does what the poem needs: it earns friendship through a physical metaphor without naming \"friendship.\" The stairwell at 3:26 AM is precise and specific enough to anchor the whole piece.\n\nLine 10 (\"On the counter, a blue mug with a cracked handle\u2014 / your reach for it only if no one else is awake\u2014\") has real weight because it trusts the reader. \"Only if no one else is awake\" does more work than any of the later explanations.\n\nThe banister clicking at 3:26 AM and the light registering in the chest like a metronome\u2014these are sensory and quiet enough to carry their own meaning without editorializing.\n\n---\n\n### What Isn't Working\n\n**Redundancy (lines 19\u201324):**\n\"Ocean enters the shape of a bowl left out\u2014 / not held, not saved, just the slow fill, / then light finding the lip of it, / that ring of pale where water remembers\nwhat it was before it became\nthe room.\" This is essentially the closing image repeated with three layers of explanation. The light finding the lip already did everything. Direction: cut entirely.\n\n**Explanatory collapse (lines 15\u201318):**\n\"Neither of us says *carrying.* Neither of us corrects the thermostat on Thanksgiving. The dog sleeps between us.\" This is where the poem stops trusting its own images and starts narrating what they mean. \"Carrying\" in quotes, then the thermostat, then the dog\u2014three things that all mean the same thing without deepening any of them. Direction: choose one image here. Cut two.\n\n**Overwrought metaphor (lines 12\u201314):**\n\"Your voice drops its pitch by half\u2014a hinge / rotted in the mechanism, something / we'll replace only if it stops turning entirely.\" This is a metaphor that explains itself through nested clauses.
