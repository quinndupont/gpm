      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe closing image \u2014 the envelope folding into the cereal box \"quietly\" \u2014 is the poem's strongest moment. It earns its weight because it's concrete, specific, and carries real emotional charge without announcing itself. The domestic detail does what the angle asks: it shows what people are bad at \u2014 holding things together \u2014 through a physical action rather than declaration.\n\nThe line \"he hums / a note / his wife / has heard before\" also works well structurally. The enjambment across three lines creates a sense of something circling back without explaining itself, which mirrors the man's situation: trapped in feeling he can't name or share yet.\n\nThe raven as quiet witness on the refrigerator hinge is a good central conceit \u2014 small, unobtrusive, present when no one else is.\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Sentimentality / Telling Over Showing (lines 1\u20134):**\n\"His hands open. A letter. The table edge / holds the weight.\" \u2014 \"holds the weight\" is doing emotional work that belongs to the reader, not the image. The table doesn't hold anything; it just sits there. This reads like a thesis statement before the poem begins. Direction: cut or replace with something the body does in response.\n\n**Abstraction (line 5):**\n\"He reads it once.\" \u2014 This is narrative summary where an image was needed. What does he do with his hands while reading? What's on the letter's surface that makes him pause? Direction: render the physical act of looking at a piece of paper.\n\n**Clich\u00e9 / Dead Language (line 7):**\n\"severing something\" \u2014 vague, decorative, and doing no real work. The light is described as a \"blade,\" which is sharp but doesn't connect meaningfully to what's happening inside the man. Direction: find language that references *what actually happens* when someone reads a letter they shouldn't have.\n\n**Weak Line Break (line 12):**\n\"just below / what you'd call\" \u2014 breaking on \"below\" creates no tension or surprise; it just fragments a phrase. Direction: break elsewhere, or let the line land as one unit if it's structurally dependent on compression.\n\n**Redundancy (lines 13\u201314):**\n\"The bird watches / the shaking stop, / watches the shaking start again.\" \u2014 The bird repeats its watching but the man *also* restates. This doubles without escalation. Direction: let the bird's repetition do more by giving it a detail only the bird would notice.\n\n**Weak Closing (line 18):**\n\"quietly.\" \u2014 An adverb summarizing what was already shown. Direction: trust the cereal box image, which is quieter than \"quietly.\"\n\n### Overall Direction\n\nThe poem has found its shape in the final twelve lines. Revise",
