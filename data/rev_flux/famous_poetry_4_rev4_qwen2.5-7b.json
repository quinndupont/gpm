      "draft": "In the quiet corner where hands once held,\nA worn photograph cradles light.\nFingers trace, seeking warmth no more found,\nWhispers linger on skin, soft and torn.\n\nThe quilt, now cold to touch, holds secrets untold\u2014\nThreads twisted tight by years of gentle care.\nEach knot a memory, each seam a story bold,\nYet only the fabric\u2019s texture dare.\n\nIn the kitchen, spices mingle in air,\nCinnamon and vanilla swirl like memories\u2019 smoke.\nPots simmered with love from the stove\u2019s embrace,\nNow echo hollow where once laughter broke.\n\nBooks lie open on worn cushions\u2014\nPages yellowed by time\u2019s relentless breath.\nA pencil, poised to write or erase,\nFroze mid-task as hands reached through space.\n\nFootsteps fade into dust and silence,\nLeaving floors polished smooth with years of care.\nShoes left behind in haste for the door,\nEchoes now silent where once they were clear.\n\nClothes hang lonely on a line\u2014\nSocks paired, shirts pressed to perfection\u2019s end.\nEach garment carries scents no longer sensed,\nIn fabric memories that can\u2019t be defended.",
      "critique": "What works:\n- The tactile and sensory details effectively convey the physical presence of the deceased, making their absence palpable.\n- The uneven line breaks contribute to a disjointed feel that mirrors the speaker's experience with grief.\n\nIssues (type, location, direction):\n1. **Abstraction**: Lines like \"Whispers linger on skin, soft and torn\" are abstract and can be more concrete.\n   - Consider: \"Soft whispers cling to skin, now cold.\"\n2. **Weak Line Breaks**: Some breaks disrupt the flow of imagery or meaning.\n   - Example: \"In the kitchen, spices mingle in air,\\nCinnamon and vanilla swirl like memories\u2019 smoke.\" might benefit from a break after \"air\" to separate the setting from the sensory detail.\n3. **Sentimentality**: The line \"Yet only the fabric\u2019s texture dare\" feels overly sentimental.\n   - Consider: \"Yet only the fabric's texture remains.\"\n\nDirections:\n- Revise abstract lines like \"Whispers linger on skin, soft and torn\" to something more concrete, such as \"Soft whispers cling to skin, now cold.\"\n- Adjust line breaks for better flow. For example, split the kitchen scene into two lines: \"In the kitchen, spices mingle in air,\\nCinnamon and vanilla swirl like memories' smoke.\"\n- Replace \"Yet only the fabric\u2019s texture dare\" with a more straightforward statement: \"Yet only the fabric's texture remains.\"\n\nWhen done:\nThis poem has found its shape.",
