      "draft": "In the garden's hushed embrace,\nMoths whisper secrets to blooms\u2014\nsoft hums like dreams shared in slumber.\nPetals bend, a gentle nod,\nas silent couriers carry pollen\u2019s promise.\n\nNeon lights flicker, far above,\nyet down here, darkness sings its songs.\nGrasshoppers leap and land with purpose,\nleaves rustling in low murmurings of wind\u2014\nno need for words as night's cool breath flows.\n\nBeneath the concrete jungle\u2019s roar,\nrats and mice scurry past each other unseen.\nA rat pauses at a discarded crumb,\nanother glides by, their paths so close yet lost to sight.\nSilence carries them both toward their fate\u2019s quiet dance.\n\nIn subway tunnels deep underground,\nhumans rush with purpose, oblivious.\nYet overhead, bats flutter in silent flight\u2014\na fleeting glimpse of night's shadowy whispers.\nTheir echolocation maps out unseen worlds,\nwhile humans march onward, heedless of these ghostly flights.",
      "critique": "What works:\n- The imagery of moths whispering to blooms and grasshoppers leaping with purpose creates a vivid sense of silent communication.\n- The contrast between the bustling city and the quiet life underground effectively highlights the theme.\n\nIssues:\n- **Weak Line Breaks**: Lines 3, 5, and 10 are overly long, which can disrupt the flow and make it harder to parse the imagery. Consider breaking lines where you can emphasize a key image or action.\n- **Overuse of \"Silent\"**: The word \"silent\" is used multiple times in the poem, which might feel repetitive and could be reduced for variety.\n\nDirections:\n- Shorten line 3: \"soft hums like dreams shared / in slumber.\" This breaks the line at a key moment, emphasizing the imagery.\n- Shorten line 5: \"Petals bend, a gentle nod\u2014 / as silent couriers carry pollen\u2019s promise.\" Again, breaking here helps to emphasize the action and its significance.\n- Shorten lines 12-13: \"A rat pauses at a discarded crumb, / another glides by, their paths so close yet lost to sight.\" This break emphasizes the closeness of the paths.\n\nWhen done:\nThis poem has found its shape.",
