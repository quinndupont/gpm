      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe poem has a genuine engine: the refusal to name night or darkness directly after the first stanza, and instead building through objects and actions that *become* night by implication. The kitchen sink fossils pressed into a woman's jacket pocket \u2014 that's precise, strange, and earns its weight. \"Just the frequency / where waves give up / their solid shape\" has real spatial thinking in it; the ocean conspiring with radio frequencies is genuinely surprising.\n\nThe closing gesture toward entropy (breath turning to mist) also works: it lands on something physical rather than emotional, and the word \"\u96fe\" (fog/mist/veil) introduces an unexpected register that could do more if placed earlier or developed further. The poem is most alive when it's least naming itself.\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Clich\u00e9 proximity / near-miss:** \"Not loud. Not quiet.\" \u2014 This is the poem reaching for a line it knows is clich\u00e9 and putting it right next to another line that *is* doing interesting work (\"Just the frequency\"). The repetition here doesn't shift meaning; it just restates. Direction: cut this entirely, or replace with something as precise as what follows.\n\n**Abstraction bloat:** \"work / you'll only name / after it dies\" \u2014 This collapses back into explanation where the poem should be trusting its own images. \"A root system, a web\" is already abstracting from the physical; naming the abstraction (\"memory\") on top of that makes it inert. Direction: return to the kitchen sink detail and let *that* carry the weight without editorializing.\n\n**Line 14-15:** \"Just the frequency / where waves give up / their solid shape\" \u2014 The line break after \"solid shape\" is weak; it creates a flat pause that doesn't earn tension. Direction: try breaking before \"give up,\" so the phrase itself lands as its own unit of strangeness.\n\n**Line 24-25:** \"the way anything alive / stays underground\" \u2014 This collapses into generality after building toward something specific (fossils, stones). Direction: replace with a single image that *is* what it means. What does the night actually pull up? A specific thing, not \"anything.\"\n\n**Line 30-31:** \"Somewhere in the building / someone's breath has turned\" \u2014 The poem stumbles here; \"breath turning\" into mist is too close to clich\u00e9 (exhalation fogging glass), and \"somewhere in the building\" retreats from specificity. Direction: name the room, or make the image stranger still.\n\n**Repetition without shift:** \"opens doors / you didn't know were closed\" \u2014 The line returns with no new information. Direction: if repetition",

      "critique": "## Revision Workshop Response\n\n---\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe kitchen sink fossils pressed into a woman's jacket pocket \u2014 that is the poem's strongest moment: precise, strange, and grounded in a real object. The opening corridor/walking-through-walls image also works as a concrete entry point.\n\n\"Light skips / across the silver tile, leaving\na draft, a current\ncurling under the baseboard.\" \u2014 This has spatial awareness. \"Skips\" is doing something specific rather than generic. The light becomes a physical thing that leaves drafts behind.\n\n\"Not loud. Not quiet.\" \u2014 The poem knows it's reaching here and the workshop flagged this as weak repetition without shift. That instinct is correct, but the weakness is worth isolating from the revision of what follows.\n\n---\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Clich\u00e9 proximity / near-miss:** \"Not loud. Not quiet.\" \u2014 Repeated in lines 17-18 with no progression. Direction: cut entirely or replace with a single image that does the work both times. The poem restates here and then shifts meaning later (\"waves slide off course\"), so this repetition is functionally dead.\n\n**Abstraction bloat:** \"Just the frequency / where waves give up / their solid shape\" \u2014 Abstracts from a physical phenomenon into explanation, not poetry. Direction: replace with something as precise as \"hearing radio in another room.\" The poem already knows how to stay concrete; this passage retreats.\n\n**Line 14-15:** \"Just the frequency / where waves give up / their solid shape\" \u2014 Line break after \"solid shape\" is weak, creating a flat pause. Direction: break before \"give up,\" so \"waves give up\" lands as its own unit of strangeness.\n\n**Line 20-23:** \"It presses its fingers\ninto the earth and pulls up\nwhat you'd call memory:\na root system, a web,\nthe way anything alive\nstays underground\ndoing work\nyou'll only name\nafter it dies.\" \u2014 \"Memory\" is doing the opposite of what the poem has been asking darkness to do: naming itself. Direction: replace \"memory\" with a specific physical thing. The root system/web language is already abstracting from the copper wire image that precedes it; stay in one register.\n\n**Line 24-25:** \"Somewhere in the building / someone's breath has turned\" \u2014 Too vague, too close to clich\u00e9 (breath fogging glass). Direction: name the room. The poem is most alive when it commits to a single physical space rather than drifting into atmosphere.\n\n**Structural issue:** The poem shifts from concrete objects (fossils in pocket, copper wire) to radio frequencies to memory/entertainment to breath/mist \u2014 this is too many moves without grounding each one. Direction: cut or compress the middle section (lines 1",

      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n---\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe kitchen sink fossils pressed into a woman's jacket pocket \u2014 that is the poem's strongest moment: precise, strange, and grounded in a real object. The opening corridor/walking-through-walls image also works as a concrete entry point.\n\n\"Light skips / across the silver tile, leaving\na draft, a current\ncurling under the baseboard.\" \u2014 This has spatial awareness. \"Skips\" is doing something specific rather than generic. The light becomes a physical thing that leaves drafts behind.\n\n\"Not loud. Not quiet.\" \u2014 The poem knows it's reaching here and the workshop flagged this as weak repetition without shift. That instinct is correct, but the weakness is worth isolating from the revision of what follows.\n\n---\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Clich\u00e9 proximity / near-miss:** \"Not loud. Not quiet.\" \u2014 Repeated in lines 17-18 with no progression. Direction: cut entirely or replace with a single image that does the work both times. The poem restates here and then shifts meaning later (\"waves slide off course\"), so this repetition is functionally dead.\n\n**Abstraction bloat:** \"Just the frequency / where waves give up / their solid shape\" \u2014 Abstracts from a physical phenomenon into explanation, not poetry. Direction: replace with something as precise as \"hearing radio in another room.\" The poem already knows how to stay concrete; this passage retreats.\n\n**Line 14-15:** \"Just the frequency / where waves give up / their solid shape\" \u2014 Line break after \"solid shape\" is weak, creating a flat pause. Direction: break before \"give up,\" so \"waves give up\" lands as its own unit of strangeness.\n\n**Line 20-23:** \"It presses its fingers\ninto the earth and pulls up\nwhat you'd call memory:\na root system, a web,\nthe way anything alive\nstays underground\ndoing work\nyou'll only name\nafter it dies.\" \u2014 \"Memory\" is doing the opposite of what the poem has been asking darkness to do: naming itself. Direction: replace \"memory\" with a specific physical thing. The root system/web language is already abstracting from the copper wire image that precedes it; stay in one register.\n\n**Line 24-25:** \"Somewhere in the building / someone's breath has turned\" \u2014 Too vague, too close to clich\u00e9 (breath fogging glass). Direction: name the room. The poem is most alive when it commits to a single physical space rather than drifting into atmosphere.\n\n**Structural issue:** The poem shifts from concrete objects (fossils in pocket, copper wire) to radio frequencies to memory/entertainment to breath/mist \u2014 this is too many moves without grounding each one. Direction: cut or compress the middle section (lines 14",
