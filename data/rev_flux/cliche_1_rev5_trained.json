It belongs in the brief's prohibited list. **Direction:** Replace with something as particular as \"blocks and school reports.\" The specificity is already there; name it directly.\n\n**Tonal inconsistency / softness (line 10):**\n\"her voice on the line / soft and ahead of what I needed\" \u2014 \"soft\" appears twice in a short passage, and \"ahead of what I needed\" is vague. Does she speak too soon? Too late? **Direction:** Make the timing precise or cut the line entirely.\n\n**Weak line breaks (lines 12\u201313):**\n\"A closet with a chair inside it / the kind you use to reach the top shelf\" \u2014 \"inside it\" is redundant. More importantly, this reads as furniture catalog prose. What does the shelf hold? What does reaching for it feel like? **Direction:** Give the shelf one real object.\n\n**Redundancy (lines 19\u201320):**\n\"Folding laundry / folded silent, stacked silent\" \u2014 \"silent\" appears twice in a row with no development between them.

  "final_poem": "She was on the stairs, counting\nbackward \u2014 her voice\nalready turning toward whatever\nshe had come for.\n\nThe kettle clicked\non its base. The faucet\nremembered how far a child's mouth\nmust open before water became drinkable.\n\nA closet with a chair.\nLaundry stacked tall enough to reach\nthe bin rims \u2014 no folding sound,\njust the slow construction of white\n\nand dark, each pile\ndeclaring what won't fit in one basket.\n\nSomewhere her keys are turning locks.\nI know because the front door\nholds still for her touch,\nand the hall closet breathes\nonly on the schedule she kept.\n\nA kettle clicking.\nThe stairs receiving their weight\nwithout her hands. The chair\nin the closet angled wrong \u2014 someone\nstole the balance from it, too.\n\nI'm writing this with my mouth\naround a pen cap, trying to make\nthe shape say something,\nand each attempt peels back\nthe skin of what I mean\nuntil the bone is just the clicking\nagain.",
