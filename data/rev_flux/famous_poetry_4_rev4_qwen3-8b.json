      "critique": "**What\u2019s alive:**  \nThe metaphor of death as a shadow flickering at the edge of a clock\u2019s ticking is precise and original. The moth drifting through gears and the pendulum\u2019s \u201cquestion mark without a reply\u201d anchor the poem in domestic mechanics, avoiding overt darkness. The rhythm of the ticking clock is mirrored in the enjambment and line breaks, creating a tactile sense of time\u2019s passage.  \n\n**Issues:**  \n- **Weak line break** after \u201cleans\u201d in the first line: The break disrupts the flow of the shadow\u2019s movement. Tighten the line to maintain momentum.  \n- **Clich\u00e9 risk** in \u201ca borrowed silence, not a final hush\u201d: \u201cFinal hush\u201d echoes the overused \u201cend of suffering\u201d and \u201crest in peace.\u201d Replace with a more original descriptor.  \n- **Abstraction** in \u201ca shadow stretching where the light won\u2019t bend\u201d: The metaphor is vague. Specify the shadow\u2019s interaction with light (e.g., \u201cwhere light refuses to meet\u201d) to ground it in the",
