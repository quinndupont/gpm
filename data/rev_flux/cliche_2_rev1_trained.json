      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### What's Alive\n\nThe central conceit \u2014 two bodies locking together involuntarily in a moment of crisis, where \"neither party chose it\" \u2014 is genuinely strong. The poem earns its title by staying inside the physical event and refusing to name love or connection. That refusal is the real subject.\n\nThe line \"the floor has dropped / four degrees\" works because it's specific, measurable, grounded in sensory observation rather than emotional declaration. It trusts the reader to feel vertigo without saying so.\n\n\"The concrete continues / its work\" \u2014 this closing gesture lands because it returns to the literal world from the poem's interior. The metaphor (gravity, coupling) is earned by what precedes it.\n\nThe detail of smelling \"copper and recent soil\" does real physical work; it's one of the few moments where the body's specific chemistry appears rather than being summarized.\n\n### What Isn't Working\n\n**Abstraction bloat: lines 17\u201324.** The poem's best instinct \u2014 to stay quiet, clinical, almost forensic \u2014 is abandoned here and replaced with a pile of abstractions dressed as revelation: \"mechanics,\" \"gravity,\" \"holding,\" \"nothing ends.\" These words *explain* the experience rather than letting it persist on its own terms. **Direction:** Cut or radically compress this passage. The poem already does what this section says in lines 12\u201315 (\"two opposing / pulleys catching on each other's / specific architecture\"). Trust that image more fully.\n\n**Redundancy / structural collapse: final three lines.** \"Nothing ends here,\" \"the concrete continues / its work. Only we / have finished something\"\u2014this is the poem restating itself in near-identical language. The closing couplet (\"a coupling of what holding / means\") circles without deepening. **Direction:** End on a single, sharpened image or action, not a summary. Let the altar of bone (line 16) do the philosophical work alone \u2014 it already implies permanence and transience simultaneously.\n\n**Line breaks in lines 5\u20137.** \"you are already / pressing the back of your neck / against mine, not touching,\" \u2014 breaking after \"already\" creates a false pause that weakens momentum. Breaking on \"not touching\" delays the reader from registering the physical gesture before the qualifier arrives. **Direction:** Break at \"mine\" or \"not.\" The word gets its weight either way; the enjambment doesn't add anything here.\n\n**Clich\u00e9: line 21.** \"our faces\" as a generic body-part stand-in for expression is thin. It's doing nothing the poem hasn't already covered with bone and blood. **Direction:** Replace with something specific to this moment \u2014 what does the blood actually do in those faces?\n\n**Syntactic congestion (lines 9\u201310):** \"the floor has dropped / four degrees",
