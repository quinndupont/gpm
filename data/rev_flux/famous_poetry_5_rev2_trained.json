      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe closing conceit \u2014 the name one can't quite place, whose mouth-shape was only ever someone else's \u2014 earns genuine compression. It does real work: it shifts scale from a bird in a hallway to the experience of recognition itself as something that happens between people without words or even without awareness. That's the poem's engine.\n\nThe stair-step detail (line 19) is precise and earned. A bird on a building's stoop, stepping down \u2014 this is particular and carries weight because it's grounded in observation rather than mood-setting.\n\n\"Puting one foot down, / then the other, each step / calculated in a language\" \u2014 that line earns its brevity. The verb \"calculated\" does more work than almost any sentence I've read about animal movement. It quietly implies intention without naming it as such.\n\nThe gap between lines 17\u201320 is structurally sound: the poem stops *telling* and lets silence be a thing on the page, which is precisely what the brief asked for.\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Clich\u00e9 intrusion (line 5):** \"not fleeing, not seeking\" \u2014 this is a list of negations that reads like a clich\u00e9 template. It tells us the bird *isn't* doing things rather than letting the reader see what it's actually doing. Direction: cut or replace with an image. What does the bird *do*? Follow its legs remember as the earth\" is already working \u2014 build from that.\n\n**Expository prose masquerading as line (line 12):** \"I pressed delete three days ago / and the body doesn't know yet.\" This narrates backstory in a way that breaks the poem's contract. The bird walks down the hallway; the speaker has deleted something *offscreen*. Let those two images sit together without explaining one to the other. Direction: either make this image visible (show what was deleted, or better, don't) or cut it entirely.\n\n**Abstraction at line 20:** \"Not warmth. Pressure\u2014the kind of / silence that exists when two things / move through exactly the same space / with no knowledge of each other's weight.\" This is where the poem stops being precise and starts theorizing. \"Silence\" has already been on the page as a gap between lines, and here it gets redefined twice (\"pressure,\" \"silence\"). Direction: replace this with one concrete image \u2014 what does it look like when two things occupy the same space without knowing? A shadow? A vibration?\n\n**Redundancy (lines 13\u201315):** The stair-step detail is strong, but \"the third stair-step\" and \"a tube of glass",

      "critique": "## Revision Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe closing conceit \u2014 \"last seen, last seen\" as a name one can't quite place \u2014 is the poem's strongest moment. It earns compression and genuine feeling through its repetition and double meaning.\n\n\"Puting one foot down, / then the other, each step / calculated in a language\" lands because of the verb choice (\"calculated\") and the brevity. The bird's movement becomes a stand-in for the speaker's own unknowable calculation about what happened three days ago.\n\nThe stair-step detail (line 19) \u2014 \"each one the same, each one / the exact length of a breath held\" \u2014 is precise and earned. It moves from image to lived physical sensation without explanation, which is exactly right.\n\nThe gap between lines 17\u201320 works structurally: the poem stops narrating and lets silence be visible on the page. That's the brief's central instruction, and it succeeds here.\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Clich\u00e9 intrusion (line 5):** \"not fleeing, not seeking\" \u2014 this is a list of negations that reads like a clich\u00e9 template.
