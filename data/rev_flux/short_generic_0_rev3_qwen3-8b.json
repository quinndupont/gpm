      "draft": "Whispers of dusk brush the twilight's edge,  \nA tapestry woven with fading light.  \nFootprints in sand, the moon's soft pledge\u2014  \nTime's silent dance, a fleeting flight.  \n\nBeneath the stars, the earth does sleep,  \nDreams of the day in silence keep.  \nEach breath a note, each moment steeped  \nIn the quiet hymn of what we reap.  \n\nThe clock's hands turn, a gentle rhyme,  \nA story etched in every line.  \nThough seasons change, the soul still climbs,  \nThrough the veil of time, forever sublime.",
      "critique": "What's alive:  \nThe imagery of dusk, tapestry, footprints, and moon\u2019s pledge creates a vivid, atmospheric scene. The consistent meter and rhyme (ABAB) give the poem a musical quality. Themes of time, transience",
