Not storm. Not sunny.\nThe kind of climate that has lasted so long\nyou forget it was ever up for choice.\n\nI've watched you open tangerines wrong all your life;\nI could finish your sentence before you said it.\nThese are not plotlines, these are bone structure\u2014\nhow you hold your palm when you pray,\nhow patient you are with the kids in kindergarten,\n\nhow you look at me from the doorway\nat two a.m. and don't need anything\nexcept for me to know I'm wanted.\n\nWe didn't write our own happily ever after.\nIt was more like finding the mailbox\nalready full of letters we never addressed,\neach one sealed with exactly the right stamp.\n\nI used to think that meant someone else was choosing us.\nNow I think it meant we were always already home,\n\njust moving furniture, just adjusting\nthe thermostat, just learning\nto say *later* instead of *never.*\n\nSo here's to the kind of love that doesn't declare itself\u2014\nthe one that arrives wearing your old coat,\nthat knows the way to my kitchen without looking.\n\nTo us and whatever keeps coming next.\nNot a story. A climate. And I'm in it\nfor however long it is.\n\nThe tangerine's still open wrong.\nYou're standing there with it, patient as ever,\n\nand I don't mind at all because this is the sound\na house makes when it finally stops\ntrying to be somewhere else\u2014this is us,\nfinally settled into whatever we were always meant to be,\n\nwhich isn't euphemism. It's just Tuesday.\nAnd we're here again. And you're peeling fruit.\n\nKeep doing that. I'll finish your sentences.\nWe won't need them anymore.",
