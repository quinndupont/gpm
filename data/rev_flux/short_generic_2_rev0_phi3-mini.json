  "final_poem": "Beneath skies of azure gleam,  \nWhere sunbeams dance and streams stream,  \nArise from winter' endless night,  \nAnd welcome back Spring\u2019s delightful sight:    \nA canvas splashed with colors bright;          \nAdorned in hues that banish blight.     \nWith petals flushed like morning rose,      \nFrom cold asleep the sleeping pose awake -  Unfurling and spread their charm anew, under azure skies of eternal daybreak\u2019s glare where sunbeams dance to paint a picture clear:   The earth revives; she sigh.     Now in our sightly view      \nA vibrant world unfurls before us-    A celebration without measure or cease!  Spring is the season now, as life renewed on every blade of grass and leaf - Our hearts take flight like birds released from cages to sing their songs for joy. The time has come again when earth sighs beneath her verdant mantle; here she restores herself after winter's long siege-    From Winter\u2019 endless night: \nThe frost retreats, and thawing streams   Do humbly bow at Nature's green revival. The sun stands guard over all this beauty as it unfolds upon her emerald shoulders; thus begins our journey through the season of Spring in its glorious revelation\u2014a time when hope takes form within every living thing:   \nFrom Winter\u2019 endless night,   Under skies where dreams are born and never die -  As we walk these paths carpeted with newfound green- Our spirits rise to join this resurrection scene. Spring arrives at last without fail or fear of loss; behold the spectacle she bestows upon us\u2014A time when life rekindles its fire within every seed, stone and soul alike:   The earth revives - \nFrom Winter\u2019s endless night To springtime's sweet embrace We journey forth on paths carpeted with newfound green;
