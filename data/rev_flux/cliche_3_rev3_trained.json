      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### What's Alive\n\nThe central conceit \u2014 refrigerators as characters, old ice boxes groaning when opened too wide \u2014 is genuinely strong. The poem earns this through specific physical detail: \"metallic teeth / click shut a fraction wider than they should.\" That's observation, not invention.\n\nThe fogging windowpane passage works well. \"Fog / spell out *open me* in reverse\" creates the right tension between intimacy and strangeness without naming either. The line break after \"fog\" isolates it as its own sensory moment before the word-reading arrives \u2014 that's a good instinct for control.\n\nThe backyard door sequence also lands: \"slide, click, slide\" with my sister's name on the weatherstripping, fading like something *swallowed and not quite digested*. That image does real emotional work without explaining itself. The closing image of fogged glass reading *Exit* then *re-enter* earns its ambiguity because it arrives after building enough domestic texture.\n\nThe poem is strongest when it stays inside the body and the house \u2014 at 2 AM, before everyone wakes up. That's where the strangeness lives concretely.\n\n---\n\n### What Isn't Working\n\n**Sentimentality / Over-explanation (lines 37\u201346):**\n\"This is a poem about refrigerators as characters \u2014 not the white ones with digital displays, but the old ones with ice boxes that groan and moan when you try to force them open too wide. The air conditioner still running in December because nobody bothered to shut it off last spring; it's coughing up cold air like a smoker.\" This passage is the brief re-written into the poem. Cut or radically compress it \u2014 it tells what the images should already show.\n\n**Abstraction and summary (lines 31\u201340):**\n\"the house / has gone architectural\u2014every door\nlocked from the inside, every hallway\npainted with such evenness I keep expecting\nto find new rooms.\" This is vague. What doors? What hallway? \"Such evenness\" is a dead metaphor for paint \u2014 it doesn't land because there's nothing precise to see. Direction: replace this with one actual visual detail of a specific hallway. What color? What light source?\n\n**Clich\u00e9 (line 27):**\n\"each one a separate sentence.\" This is the poem's own self-commentary that reads as filler.\n\n**Redundancy / Structural bloat (lines 40\u201351):**\nThe closing paragraph essentially restates what was said in lines 31\u201340, then adds \"the attic,\" \"my father's box of medals\" \u2014 details that feel like inherited furniture rather than chosen images. The poem is strongest when it stays with the refrigerator and the fogged windowpane. Direction: end closer to line 27 or at most one more image after that.\n\n**Weak line breaks (lines 1",

      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n---\n\n### What's Alive\n\nThe refrigerator as conspiring character is the strongest engine. \"Metallic teeth / click shut a fraction wider than they should\" \u2014 that precision of observation does real work: it makes the fridge strange without editorializing.\n\nThe fogging windowpane passage from lines 7\u201312 has genuine compression and tension. The word-reading happens in the break between two lines, which is a good instinct for how images can do their own meaning-making. \"Exit\" / \"re-enter\" earns its ambiguity because it arrives after building enough domestic texture.\n\nThe backyard door sequence (lines 35\u201340) also has real energy: \"slide, click, slide,\" the name on weatherstripping fading like something swallowed \u2014 that's a specific image with genuine strangeness. The poem is strongest when it stays inside the body and the house at 2 AM before everyone wakes.\n\n---\n\n### What Isn't Working\n\n**Sentimentality / Over-explanation (lines 1\u20138):**\nThe opening passage reads as the brief rewritten into the poem \u2014 \"conspires with silence,\" \"metallic teeth,\" \"holding / the edge of something soft inside\" (bread, maybe). This is where the poem loses its engine and starts explaining itself. Direction: cut or radically compress this setup to one or two lines maximum.

      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n---\n\n### What's Alive\n\nThe refrigerator-as-conspirator engine is the strongest structural idea. Lines 13\u201314 (\"I press my face against the Mylar skin and watch fog / spell out *open me* in reverse\") have genuine tension \u2014 the word-reading happens at the line break, which is a good instinct for how images can do their own work without explanation.\n\nThe hallway door hanging off its left hinge (line 27) has real domestic specificity. That crack letting light through sideways earns its place because it's precise and slightly uncanny.\n\nThe dog curled on the leather where the daughter sat \u2014 that image does what the poem needs: a physical trace, a body absent but present in texture.\n\nThe closing \"Exit\" / \"re-enter\" fogged pane sequence (lines 37\u201340) builds enough domestic atmosphere to justify its abstraction. It's the strongest ending because it trusts the reader.\n\n---\n\n### What Isn't Working\n\n**Sentimentality / Editorializing (throughout):**\nThe poem keeps explaining itself in prose that undermines what it wants to do as a poem. \"Somewhere a smoke alarm has gone quiet / inside a wall it doesn't trust\" \u2014 personification here is doing sentiment rather than image. The baseboard heater line (\"clicks its slow clock, keeping time\") similarly narrates feeling instead of rendering scene.\n\n**Clich\u00e9 and dead language (lines 19\u201320):**\n\"The dog curls on the leather where my daughter sat / November third\" \u2014 \"November third\" is specific but \"curls on the leather\" is not. The poem tells us this is a memory without letting the body do what a body does in cold leather.\n\n**Redundancy (lines 31\u201340):**\nThe attic passage (lines 37\u201340) essentially restates lines 29\u201336 with \"my father's box of medals\" added. The poem is already there \u2014 it doesn't need to return to the same ground. Direction: cut or radically compress this entire section.\n\n**Weak line breaks / prose syntax masquerading as poetry (lines 7\u20138, 15):**\n\"Fog spell out *open me* in reverse\" \u2014 \"spell out\" is a dead phrase here. Direction: break after \"fog\" so the word-reading happens at the line edge with no intervening clause.\n\n**Tonal inconsistency / self-commentary (line 27):**\n\"The dog curls on the couch where my daughter\nsat November third, her hoodie still hippo\" \u2014 \"her hoodie still hippo\" is a mangled image trying to be wry. It doesn't land as wit or strangeness. Direction: cut it entirely or find one precise physical detail.\n\n**Structural bloat (lines 21\u201330):**\nThe hallway and smoke alarm passage is filler that adds atmosphere without",
