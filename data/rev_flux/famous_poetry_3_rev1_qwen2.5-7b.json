      "draft": "In the hush where phone lights dance,\nSnowflakes kiss cold glass, each one a promise.\nThe forest murmurs with electronic song\u2014\na siren's soft hum that pierces winter\u2019s bone.\n\nBeneath my feet, white silence whispers secrets:\nancient trees watch as screens flicker, shadows loom.\nA world of beeps and blips in the crisp night air,\ncontradicts the calm, natural breaths of earth drawn near.\n\nDuty calls\u2014emails drip with urgency like icicles\nglistening under moonlight, a digital cold comfort.\nYet here I am, trapped in this paradox, nature\u2019s allure clashing \nwith societal ties that bind, tightening their icy grip. \n\nNotifications pulse\u2014a rhythm against the silence,\nbeckoning me from the hushed woods and into their glow.\nInside my head, thoughts fray like branches stripped of leaves:\nshouldn\u2019t I tend to these fires, let them burn?\n\nBut outside, the real world hums softly\u2014\nthe scent of pine and damp earth, a deeper kind of light.\nIf only for an instant, could I break free?\nJust this once, live in nature\u2019s glow, not screens\u2019 cold delight.",
      "critique": "What's Alive:\n- The vivid contrast between natural and digital imagery, particularly the \"phone lights dance\" and \"forest murmurs with electronic song.\"\n- The emotional tension between nature\u2019s allure and societal obligations.\n- The use of sensory details like \"pine and damp earth,\" which add depth to the poem.\n\nIssues:\n1. **Weak Line Breaks**: Lines 3 and 4 are too closely connected, creating a run-on effect that disrupts the flow. Consider breaking the line after \"song\u2014\"\n2. **Clich\u00e9**: The phrase \"a world of beeps and blips\" is somewhat clich\u00e9d in modern poetry contexts.\n3. **Sentimentality**: Lines like \"shouldn\u2019t I tend to these fires, let them burn?\" lean towards a more emotional appeal than the poem needs.\n\nDirections:\n- Break line 4 after \"song\u2014\": \n  - \"a siren's soft hum that pierces winter\u2019s bone.\"\n- Replace \"beeps and blips\" with something fresher, perhaps \"digital whispers\":\n  - \"contradicts the calm, natural breaths of earth drawn near.\"\n- Revise the last stanza to maintain the tension without leaning too heavily on emotional appeals:\n  - \"Notifications pulse\u2014a rhythm against the silence,\n    beckoning me from the hushed woods and into their glow.\n    Inside my head, thoughts fray like branches stripped of leaves\u2014\n    should I heed these calls or stay in nature\u2019s embrace?\"\n\nWhen done, this poem has found its shape.",
