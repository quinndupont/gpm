      "draft": "# What the Ear Knows\n\nThe frequency dropped. Not a note but\nthe frayed start of what had been,\na guitar string pulled too hard, its life\nrecoiling from the machine that kept it taut.\n\nOutside the window, someone's name\nwas wearing down the fluorescent tube's thin skin\u2014\n*a-ny-o-ne* \u2014 each repetition etching\na groove like a record skipped at midnight,\n\nthe needle catching on the *o*, skipping forward,\nlosing the whole word in static.\nI was standing in a hallway. I could feel\nthe diaphragm of the building shuddering\n\nwith every siren that didn't leave.\nThere is a pitch to abandonment: 412 Hz,\nthey say, though no one calibrates it. It lives\nin HVAC return vents where cotton insulation\n\nhums against the duct and what starts as air\nbecomes the sound of something listening back.\nI know because my teeth began to edge\ntogether \u2014 that small percussion, that jaw\n\nlocking its own lute \u2014 trying to vibrate\nthrough whatever kept tightening. A belt\non a pulley outside a warehouse near midnight,\nsnapping one tooth at a time,\n\nand the pitch rise of something going wrong\nthat keeps rising because silence isn't empty\nbut another frequency, the one sound\nwith no amplitude\u2014  the membrane\n\nstill moving, still perceiving,\nwhile everything inside and out\nkeeps ticking over its own self-destruct curve.\nI heard it before anyone else did.\n\nThe speaker in me was already wearing thin.",
      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe siren sequence (lines 20\u201324) is the strongest passage in the poem. \"It keeps rising because silence isn't empty / but another frequency, the one sound\" \u2014 that line earns its abstraction because it arrives after a concrete accumulation of physical detail. The belt skipping teeth gets the same spirit as the vinyl skipping: repetition, wear, self-destruction.\n\nThe hallway opening (lines 4\u20138) also works well. \"Wearing down the fluorescent tube's thin skin\" is precise and surprising \u2014 that verb *wearing* does real double work (corrosion and speech). The record-skipping image gets deployed cleanly here without the rhyme dragging it off course.\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Rhyme contamination (throughout, but especially lines 1\u20138):** The poem is attempting a free verse or constrained lineation scheme \u2014 short tight lines with enjambment doing rhythmic work. But the rhymes are leaking into and warping those intentions:\n\n- **Line 2: \"Not a note but / the frayed start of what had been\"** \u2014 \"frayed\" reaches toward \"taut,\" which is the expected rhyme, not an actual ear-opening word for this passage. The opening should establish the industrial acoustic world without importing domestic rhyme.\n- **Line 4: \"its life / recoiling from the machine that kept it taut\"** \u2014 same taut/rife slant rhyme creeping in where none was needed. Cut or replace with something that doesn't reference the rhyme of line 2.\n- **Line 6: \"each repetition etching\"** \u2014 \"etching\" is doing nothing except trying to land on \"skin.\" The verb here should be about sound, not sculpture.\n- **Line 8: \"a record skipped at midnight,\" \"the *o*, skipping forward\"** \u2014 the rhyme scheme is dictating where the siren image goes. The poem would be better served by cutting or replacing that line with something that stays in the hallway and the speaker's body.\n\n**Abstraction without grounding (lines 17\u201324):** After the warehouse/belt passage, the poem abandons its own material. \"The one sound / with no amplitude\" \u2014 this is a thesis statement about silence, not an experience of it. \"Still perceiving\" in line 23 is pure abstraction doing no sensory work. The self-destruct curve (line 24) is a graph imported into the poem rather than something heard.\n\n**Direction:** Strip every rhyme from lines 1\u20138 and rewrite those opening eight lines entirely \u2014 rebuild them on industrial acoustics, not domestic phonetics. Let the siren/rhyme pairing in line 20 be the template for how sound should arrive: concrete, precise, earned. Cut or radically rework lines 17",
