      "draft": "In the concert hall of their souls, two cellos echo,\nResonance humming through silent air.\nEach note from one stirs the strings within another,\nA duet not whispered but played in earnest.\n\nThe first's sorrow, a deep D, sets off vibrations\u2014\nA low thrum that ripples through her being.\nThen his answer: a G sharp, like moonlight on water.\nTheir tones intertwine, a night full of stars.\n\nBass notes from his chest meet the timbre of her,\nLow and steady as a stone dropped in stillness.\nViolins join them with their light, their dance.\nTogether they create a harmony unseen,\nYet heard in every chord that fills this space between.\n\nShe listens for the beats that align\u2014\nThe pulse where strings converge.\nIn each measure, in every pause they take,\nA shared silence speaks louder than words can make.\n\nTheir hearts are instruments tuned just right,\nPlaying music meant only for them tonight.",
      "critique": "What works:\n- The metaphor of hearts as instruments in a duet is fresh and engaging.\n- The imagery of resonance and sound waves adds depth to the emotional landscape.\n- The use of musical terms like \"cellos,\" \"G sharp,\" and \"timbre\" effectively conveys the thematic elements.\n\nIssues (type, location, direction):\n1. **Weak Line Breaks**: Lines 3 and 4 could be more effective if split differently. Consider breaking after \"humming through silent air\" to emphasize the initial silence before the resonance.\n2. **Overly Abstract Language**: Phrases like \"A duet not whispered but played in earnest\" are abstract and might benefit from concrete examples or clearer imagery.\n3. **Sentimentality**: The line \"In each measure, in every pause they take, / A shared silence speaks louder than words can make\" leans towards sentimentality. It could be more impactful if grounded in specific musical details.\n\nDirections:\n- Revise the line break after \"humming through silent air\" to emphasize the initial silence.\n- Replace abstract lines with concrete examples: For instance, instead of \"A duet not whispered but played in earnest,\" consider something like \"Their first note a deep D, a whisper that stirs.\"\n- Ground the sentimentality in specific musical details. For example, replace the last two lines with: \"In each measure, in every pause they take, / The strings vibrate, their silent conversation.\"\n\nWhen these adjustments are made, this poem has found its shape.",
