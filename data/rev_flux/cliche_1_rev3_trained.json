      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe central conceit \u2014 a mother who changes everything through domestic ritual, and the child only understanding decades later \u2014 is genuinely strong. The poem earns its weight in the second half where repetition and inheritance become visible rather than explained.\n\n\"Because the answer was never mine to hold,\njust the sound, just the click, just the thing left over.\"\n\nThat line works because it's concrete, unadorned, and does real emotional lifting without reaching for sentimentality. The kitchen sequence (mug, kettle running on after quiet) is where the poem finds its actual shape \u2014 specific objects doing symbolic work with restraint.\n\nThe closing image of the child handing the speaker a cup: that's earned through everything preceding it. It's not decorative; it's structural.\n\n\"The dog keeps barking at a shadow\" \u2014 this simile lands because it's unexpected and true, where so much domestic poetry defaults to clich\u00e9.\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Clich\u00e9 resurgence (lines 9\u201310):**\n> miles wide / my car humming with its old suspense\n>\n\"miles wide\" is dead language \u2014 it belongs to movies, not lived distance. \"Old suspense\" is the poem reaching for atmosphere by name. Direction: Cut both. Replace with something that physically describes what a child's departure actually feels like in a kitchen or driveway.\n\n**Abstraction bloat (lines 17\u201320):**\n> some circuit closed, some household prayer / I'd never memorized but answered anyway\n>\nThis is the poem explaining its own metaphor to itself. The reader doesn't need \"circuit\" and \"prayer\" \u2014 those are abstractions doing the work that \"clicking a door at 3 AM\" could do in two words. Direction: Cut or compress. Let the action carry weight without taxonomizing it.\n\n**Sentimentality (line 25):**\n> Just keep letting the house sound like something\n>\nThis line softens what should be precise and physical \u2014 \"sound like something.\" What does it sound like? Direction: Name the actual sound, or cut the line entirely. It's doing emotional work with vagueness.\n\n**Redundancy / padding (lines 27\u201330):**\n> In the towel that's worn into a shape\n> only a hand knows.\n> In the mug I keep warming up\n> for no one.\n> In the kettle that keeps running on\n>\nThese three lines are essentially saying the same thing. The kettle line is the strongest; the mug line repeats it without advance. Direction: Keep the kettle or the mug \u2014 cut one.\n\n**Weak opening image (lines 1\u20134):**\n> She left the kettle on again, that old\n> blue one with the cracked handle she kept\n> even after the others got replaced.\n> The coffee maker binged its cycle through,\n",

What's Alive\n\nThe kitchen sequence from line 9 onward is where the poem finds its actual shape. \"Miles separating us / on a highway where nothing happens\" \u2014 that compression of distance into a single sentence works. The blue mug with cracked handle (line 8) and the kettle running on after quiet (lines 26\u201327) are concrete, earned images doing symbolic work without over-explanation.\n\nThe closing image \u2014 \"just keep letting the house sound like something / someone can come home to\" \u2014 lands because it's grounded in domestic routine. The dog barking at a shadow simile is sharp and specific.\n\nThe return of key phrases (the click, the mug warming up for no one) earns repetition through shifting context rather than mere echo.\n\n### 2.
