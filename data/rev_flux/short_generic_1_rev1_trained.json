      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe central conceit \u2014 the ocean as a witness that records names on rocks rather than waves crashing ashore \u2014 is genuinely compelling. The poem earns its argument through concrete physical detail: \"the way someone presses their thumb / into soft clay to keep a promise visible\" lands hard because it's rooted in tactile memory, not abstraction.\n\nThe passage beginning \"I read it wrong / a dozen times before I read it right\" works well \u2014 the repetition of misreading becomes an image for how meaning arrives through repeated attention rather than revelation. The shift from \"wrong\" to \"right,\" then back into uncertainty (\"even then I can't be certain\"), is honest and earns its place.\n\nThe closing three lines \u2014 \"Still reads them back. / To me, today.\" \u2014 close the poem with quiet authority because the accumulated physical detail has done the work before arriving there.\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Abstraction bloat (lines 19\u201336).** The poem's second half dissolves into a catalog of vague oceanic abstractions: \"effort, what looks like script,\" \"a sentence no one / has finished saying.\" These lines are decorative rather than informative. **\"A sentence no one / has finished saying\"** is the worst offender \u2014 it tells us there's meaning without earning any through image or action. Direction: Every line in this section should contain a physical object, not a summary of what might be present.\n\n**Clich\u00e9 reappearing (line 21).** \"The moon's gentle kiss\" \u2014 the brief specifically named this as something to avoid, and it returns. This undermines trust between poet and reader. Direction: Cut or replace with an image that belongs only to *this* coastline.\n\n**Redundancy / rhetorical inflation (lines 37\u201342).** \"It doesn't crash. It remembers\" \u2014 the opening line already stated this. The final three lines (\"Still reads them back. / To me, today.\") essentially repeat what was said in the closing image of the reef with coral teeth. **The poem's ending is doing less work than its middle section, which undermines both.** Direction: The ending needs to arrive *through* a new image or action, not summarize what has already been stated.\n\n**\"A Morse code nobody learned\" (line 32).** This line gestures toward something interesting \u2014 the ocean as transmitter of secret language \u2014 but \"nobody learned\" is vague and unearned. Direction: What *did* it look like? A pattern in waves, a current's shape, something visible enough to be mistaken for code?\n\n**Line breaks that don't break anything (lines 27\u201330).** \"each notch in the rock",

It remembers.\nI've watched it open its vast mouth like a jawbone\nholding names\u2014names worn smooth\nuntil they are no longer legible, just shapes\nthe size of dinner plates, etched into the rind\nof some ancient clamshell, kept in the deep.\n\nThere was a harbor once with a particular name.\nNot on any chart. Not in any language\na minister would recognize. The stones\nbore it for three hundred years\u2014some kind of commitment,\nthe way someone presses their thumb\ninto soft clay to keep a promise visible.\n\nThen the water found it, wore the syllables\ndown to their skeletons, to the hiss and grunt,\nto what resembles a sentence no one\nhas finished saying. I read it wrong\na dozen times before I read it right,\nand even then I can't be certain\u2014I'm only\nthe first person in centuries to lean this close.\n\nThe tide goes in and out with equal purpose.\nIt doesn't crash. It executes\nits planned withdrawal, leaving behind\nwhat looks like effort, what looks like\nan attempt at script: < = >, < = >,\neach notch in the rock a mouth closing around air,\n\nand I have come here to count it as language\u2014\nthe only one who has sat on this pier\nexpecting nothing. The water peels back\nwith such care it could be practicing\nfor some event it invented.\n\nAt low tide the rocks hold names\nthe ocean swallowed whole: a dock's wooden contour,\na wharf's particular decay, the phosphorus\nof syllables worn to their mineral skeletons\u2014< = >,< = >\neach notch a brick in a reef of silence\ntaking nine hundred years to build its claim against the light,\n\nbricks so thin they could pass for teeth. I will not say\nthe ocean remembers what we didn't record.\nI'll say this: it makes a better case\n\nfor it than any court in history ever did,\nopening and closing its mouth like clockwork,\nlike something practicing for an entrance\nit has never been asked to make.
