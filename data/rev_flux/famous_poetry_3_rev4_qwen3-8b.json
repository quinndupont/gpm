The imagery of pine resin and the road\u2019s hum creates a tension between natural quiet and mechanical noise. Free verse with enjambment mirrors the speaker\u2019s hesitation, and line breaks emphasize the gap between desire and duty.  \n\n**What isn\u2019t working:**  \n- **Clich\u00e9**: \u201csnow\u2019s white veil\u201d repeats the avoided phrase \u201csilent snow\u201d and lacks originality.
