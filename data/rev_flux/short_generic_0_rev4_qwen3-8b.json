      "draft": "Static blooms where the graffiti once clung\u2014  \na language of scrawled promises, now bleached to ghostly script.  \nNeon signs drip their electric sighs into gutters,  \ntheir colors pooling like unspoken truths  \nbeneath the asphalt\u2019s breath.  \n\nIn the hospital\u2019s glass, rain etches its name  \non the circuit board of a window\u2014  \na patient\u2019s hand, a held breath,  \nall dissolved into the current.  \nThe walls remember what the water forgets:  \nthe weight of a body, the ache of a silent monitor,  \nthe way time rusts in the dark.  \n\nSome things flood away\u2014  \nthe scent of a vanished lover,  \nthe smear of a fingerprint  \non a door that never locks.  \nBut the cracks stay,  \npockets of memory  \nwhere the rain won\u2019t reach.",
      "critique": "**What\u2019s alive:**  \nThe poem successfully juxtaposes physical and emotional erosion, using circuit boards, neon signs, and hospital imagery to anchor rain\u2019s dual role as both eraser and witness. The contrast between fleeting memories (e.g., \u201cscent of a vanished lover\u201d) and enduring cracks is sharp, and the staccato rhythm of short lines mirrors rain\u2019s mechanical impact.  \n\n",
