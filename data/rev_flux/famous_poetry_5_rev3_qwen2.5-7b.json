      "draft": "Scraping against rusted metal,\nfeet find no grip, slip and slide.\nA distant hum, like thunder's echo,\nbuzzes in the ear, relentless ride.\n\nFeathers brush cold glass,\ntouching something alien, slick.\nA whisper of air, a rush to heights,\nwhere shadows dance with electric light.\n\nShadows shift, play tricks on sight,\na city\u2019s pulse, rapid heartbeat.\nWings twitch, impatience builds\u2014\nwhat secrets hide in this vast, sprawling meet?\n\nPeck at the surface, taste the strange,\nflavor of oil and steel, a foreign land.\nVoices rise, blend into a din\u2014\nhuman noises, never ending, unbound.\n\nA sudden burst of motion, flit to flight,\nseek familiar skies above the night.\nYet here it stays, curious, bold\u2014\nin this urban maze, where every step is told.",
      "critique": "What works:\n- The poem effectively uses tactile and auditory imagery to ground the bird's experience in an unfamiliar environment.\n- The enjambment mimics the bird\u2019s movement through the city, creating a sense of flight and fluidity.\n\nIssues:\n- **Abstraction**: Some lines are somewhat abstract or lack concrete detail. For example, \"A sudden burst of motion, flit to flight\" could be more vivid.\n- **Weak Line Breaks**: The line breaks in some places do not enhance the poem's flow or meaning. For instance, \"Seek familiar skies above the night.\" could benefit from a different placement.\n\nDirections:\n1. Strengthen the imagery by adding specific details. For example, instead of \"A sudden burst of motion,\" consider: \"A sudden surge of wings, slicing through the night\u2019s chill.\"\n2. Refine line breaks to enhance the poem's rhythm and meaning. Consider breaking lines where they create a pause or emphasize key words. For instance:\n   - \"Scraping against rusted metal,\n   feet find no grip, slip and slide.\n   A distant hum, like thunder's echo\u2014\n   buzzes in the ear, relentless ride.\"\n\nThis poem has found its shape.",
