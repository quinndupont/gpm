      "critique": "**What's alive:**  \nThe pantoum structure loops erosion and clarity effectively, with rain as a silent sculptor reshaping asphalt, metal, and glass. The imagery of urban decay\u2014\u201cskyline\u2019s name dissolves,\u201d \u201cmetal weeps\u201d\u2014aligns with the angle. Enjambment mimics fluidity, and the final line circles back to the opening, creating a closed loop.  \n\n**Issues:**  \n- **Redundancy:** The phrase \u201ca silent sculptor, no acclaim\u201d repeats without variation, diluting its impact.  \n- **Weak line breaks:** Lines like \u201cthe skyline\u2019s name dissolves in the rain\u2019s hand\u201d could split differently to emphasize tension between erosion and permanence.  \n- **Abstraction:** \u201cMirror\u2019s ache\u201d risks vague sentimentality; it leans on metaphor without grounding in concrete urban textures.  \n- **Clich\u00e9 risk:** \u201cMetal weeps\u201d echoes \u201csky weeps,\u201d violating the avoidance list.  \n\n**Direction",
