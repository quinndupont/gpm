      "draft": "In the shed by dawn's first light,  \nhis hands dance over metal's edge,  \na patchwork of rough and gentle touch\u2014  \ncalloused from hammer's bite,  \nfingers that cradle tools with care.\n\nAt nightfall, when shadows stretch,  \nthese hands reach through windows pane,  \ngently guiding weary eyes to rest.  \nSoft whispers of stories untold,  \ngentle as a mother's caress.\n\nIn stormy winds that rattle glass,  \nthey stand like sentinels on guard\u2014  \nnot strong as mountains, but resilient in their might.  \nRough and capable, they shield against the night.\n\nThrough broken bones, through silent tears,  \neach scar tells of battles fought.  \nYet, with every stitch and repair,  \na quiet hero emerges,  \nhis hands speak more than any word could doubt.\n\nIn quiet whispers, his strength is found\u2014  \nnot in grand gestures or empty praise,  \nbut in the everyday struggles he bears alone,  \nin hands that cradle broken dreams and mend them whole.",
      "critique": "What's Alive:\n- The imagery of hands as a patchwork of rough and gentle touch creates a nuanced portrayal.\n- The contrast between the labor in the shed and the care at night adds depth to the narrative.\n\nIssues:\n1. **Weak Line Breaks**: Lines like \"In the shed by dawn's first light,\" \"At nightfall, when shadows stretch,\" and \"Through broken bones, through silent tears\" could benefit from more strategic breaks to enhance the flow and emphasis.\n2. **Overuse of Abstract Terms**: Phrases such as \"cradle tools with care\" and \"shield against the night\" are abstract and may feel clich\u00e9 if not handled carefully.\n3. **Sentimentality**: The line \"Soft whispers of stories untold, / gentle as a mother's caress\" leans towards sentimentality, which can be overdone in poetry.\n\nDirections:\n- Revise the opening lines to emphasize the contrast between labor and care more effectively. For example, consider breaking \"In the shed by dawn's first light, his hands dance over metal's edge,\" into two lines: \"In the shed at dawn's first light, / His hands dance over metal\u2019s edge.\"\n- Replace abstract terms with more specific sensory details. Instead of \"cradle tools with care,\" try something like \"fingers that grip worn handles tightly.\" For \"shield against the night,\" consider a more vivid image such as \"stand firm in the storm\u2019s fierce embrace.\"\n- Tone down the sentimentality by focusing on concrete actions and less on emotional appeals. For instance, change \"Soft whispers of stories untold\" to \"whispers of wisdom shared.\"\n\nWhen these changes are implemented, this poem has found its shape.",
