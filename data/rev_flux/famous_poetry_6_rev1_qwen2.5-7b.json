      "draft": "Underneath the spans, shadows whisper,\nWhere daylight barely ventures its light.\nA hand prints a crumpled dollar bill\u2014\nFolded edges like ancient maps from myth.\nHere, footsteps echo, soft and hesitant,\nA silent dance with concrete's rough embrace.\n\nNeon flickers in hues unseen by day,\nFlicker of hope or mere survival\u2019s sway.\nA coat sleeve drags across the damp ground,\nCarrying stories untold since dawn.\nGloves grip at cold glass, fingers numb\u2014\nScratches mark time\u2019s cruel relentless drum.\n\nPockets clench lost coins, dreams unvoiced,\nWhere light and shade play their hushed choirs.\nIn alleyways where whispered words find shelter,\nEchoes of strength in the quietest breath.",
      "critique": "What's Alive:\n- The imagery of shadows whispering and daylight barely venturing creates a somber, reflective atmosphere.\n- The specific urban landscapes like the underside of bridges add depth and a sense of hidden resilience.\n\nIssues:\n1. **Clich\u00e9**: \"A hand prints a crumpled dollar bill\u2014Folded edges like ancient maps from myth.\" This line uses a clich\u00e9d metaphor comparing money to ancient maps.\n2. **Weak Line Breaks**: The line break after \"Here, footsteps echo\" disrupts the flow and rhythm of the poem.\n3. **Sentimentality**: \"Pockets clench lost coins, dreams unvoiced,\" leans into a sentimental tone that might overshadow the intended fragmented nature.\n\nDirections:\n1. Replace the clich\u00e9 with something more original: Consider comparing the dollar bill to \"weathered pages\" or \"scraped bark.\"\n2. Adjust line breaks for better rhythm and flow: Try breaking after \"echo\" instead of \"Here,\" which could enhance the continuity.\n3. Tone down the sentimentality by focusing on concrete details rather than directly stating emotions.\n\nWhen these adjustments are made, this poem has found its shape.",
