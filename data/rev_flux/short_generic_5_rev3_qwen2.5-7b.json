      "draft": "In pixels we sought solace,\nA screen lit in our hands.\nFinger taps, a silent dance,\nEchoes of our absent clans.\n\nMessages lingered cold,\nWhispers trapped in glassy cells.\nLike ghosts they wandered far,\nHaunting realms beyond release.\n\nVirtual arms never held tight,\nThough hearts yearned for embrace.\nData streams washed away the light\nOf faces now forever erased.\n\nEchoes faint from shared screens,\nLaughter hollow, warm yet dim.\nIn networks we tried to glean\nA truth no longer in our clinch.",
      "critique": "What's Alive:\n- The metaphor of technology as a replacement for human touch is compelling and effectively conveys the loss.\n- The fragmented structure mirrors the disjointed nature of memory and loss, which adds to the poem\u2019s impact.\n\nIssues (Type, Location, Direction):\n- **Abstraction**: Lines 3 and 4 are somewhat abstract without clear imagery. Consider grounding these lines with more specific digital interactions or physical sensations.\n  - \"Finger taps, a silent dance,\" could be enhanced by adding tactile details like \"the cold swipe of thumbs\" or \"fingers tracing the screen's cool glass.\"\n- **Weak Line Breaks**: Lines 5 and 6 have weak breaks that don\u2019t emphasize the contrast between digital presence and emotional absence as effectively.\n  - Consider breaking line 5 after \"glassy cells\" to create a stronger pause: \"Whispers trapped in / glassy cells.\"\n- **Sentimentality**: The final stanza feels slightly sentimental, particularly with phrases like \"laughter hollow, warm yet dim.\" Try to maintain a more detached tone to reinforce the poem\u2019s theme.\n  - Instead of \"laughter hollow,\" consider \"chuckles faint\" or \"whispers lost.\"\n\nDirection:\n- Ground the abstract lines with specific digital interactions and physical sensations.\n- Strengthen line breaks to emphasize key contrasts.\n- Maintain a more detached, objective tone in the final stanza.\n\nWhen these adjustments are made, this poem has found its shape.",
