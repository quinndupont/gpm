The abstraction of attention becomes a physical object in motion.\n\nThe closing image cluster (cracked earth, light bleaching afternoon into nothing) lands because each element is specific: light doing *its level best* is earned by the accumulated seriousness of what came before.\n\n### 2.

The abstraction of attention becomes a physical object in motion.\n\nThe closing image cluster (cracked earth, light bleaching afternoon into nothing) lands because each element is specific: light doing *its level best* is earned by the accumulated seriousness of what came before.\n\n---\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Redundancy / deflation \u2014 lines 15\u201323 revised.**\n- **Line 20 (revision direction):** \"What the bird sees\" -> Cut or replace with a physical gesture \u2014 the bird turns its neck at an angle no bird would turn in a garden.\n- **Lines 24\u201330 (entire closing cluster) \u2014 summary, not image.** After the poem's best work, these lines shift toward explanation rather than persistence of experience. \"The crack is still open\" and \"the left eye still shut\" are true but generic in context; they flatten the intensity of what came before.\n  - *Direction:* Replace with one or two final images that hold as much weight as \"Wind moves something against the pipe again.\" The crack, the eye, the spread leg \u2014 these three lines already do everything a closing needs.\n\n**Clich\u00e9 / dead metaphor \u2014 line 10 revised.**\n- **\"Not the speaker, not yet, but some idea of attention.\"** This is explanation, not poetry.\n  - *Direction:* Remove this line entirely or replace it with \"the left eye closes and stays closed,\" which trusts the image to carry the weight.\n\n**Redundancy \u2014 \"not stone, not gutter, not the ordinary\" (lines 12\u201314 revised).**\n- **Lines 13\u201314:** \"a screen between us\" is a dead metaphor. The crack *is* the screen; naming it as such deflates.\n  - *Direction:* Cut entirely or replace with one sharp negative \u2014 \"not stone, not gutter, not this.\"\n\n**Weak line break \u2014 lines 12\u201313 revised.**\n- **\"crack\u2014\" em-dash before \"a screen.\"** The dash plus the break make it too cluttered.\n  - *Direction:* Try breaking after \"crack\u2014\" and let",
