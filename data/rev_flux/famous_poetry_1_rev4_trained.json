      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### What's Alive\n\nThe central tension \u2014 endurance as a form of entrapment, not liberation \u2014 is the poem's real engine. The shift from \"I used to think\" into the hurricane-as-organizing-principle passage (\"the way a hurricane organizes itself\") earns its abstraction because it lands in something physical and observable. That's where the argument lives: endurance *is* organization; it doesn't free you, it structures you.\n\nThe barometric pressure passage (lines 9\u201312) is the strongest sustained stretch of writing in the poem. \"Where no front moves\" does real work \u2014 it names a condition that implies weather without resolving into one thing. The enjambment there (\"reads *wrong*\") creates genuine tension, not decoration.\n\nThe closing image \u2014 rain as company \u2014 has force because it arrives after building an argument against comfort in repetition.\n\n### What Isn't Working\n\n**Abstraction creep (lines 13\u201320).** After the hurricane passage, the poem abandons its own material. \"Resilience vs. acclimation,\" \"satellites,\" \"albedo\" \u2014 this is explanatory prose dressed as poetry. The argument *about* endurance becomes clearer than the experience of enduring. **Direction:** Cut or rewrite entirely in terms of weather data *as if the reader were inside the storm*. What does a person who reads atmosphere like a palm line actually see? Stay with the body in the environment, not the lecture about what that means.\n\n**Clich\u00e9 reappearing (line 17).** \"Flatten\" \u2014 this is a dead metaphor for climate policy. It drains energy from the sentence around it. **Direction:** Find language specific to the speaker's actual experience of being told to do something repeatedly.\n\n**Sentimentality (lines 25\u201326).** \"I stopped wishing for reset. / The cycle was never gentle\" \u2014 this is the poem summarizing its own thesis for the reader, and it softens what should be escalating tension. **Direction:** Trust the images already built. The barometric pressure, the humidity at saturation, the hurricane as organizing principle \u2014 these are doing the work of \"never gentle.\" Cut the declaration.\n\n**Weak line break (line 14).** \"each breath I take confirming / you are the climate\" \u2014 \"confirming\" is a weak verb that doesn't add compression or surprise. **Direction:** Break on something that *enacts* the confirmation, not the naming of it.\n\n**Overcrowded final stanza.** Five named weather concepts (albedo, saturation, rain, company, humidity) in six lines. The density works in principle but risks becoming a list. \"Company\" is the strongest word here \u2014 everything else around it should sharpen to support it. **Direction:** Reconsider whether \"albedo\" and \"saturation\" are both necessary. One precise image does more",

Membrans adjust their permeability.\nThe blood learns to move at a pace that matches \u2014 how you sit\nin a chair and the chair becomes part of you,\nthe two of you now conducting\n\nsome frequency no one asked about.\n\nI stopped wishing for reset. It didn't end \u2014\nyou did \u2014 and now I live in a weather system\n\nthat predates clear skies,\n\nwhere rain, if it comes,\ncomes with such familiarity\n\nit could only be described as *remembering*.\n\nThe body has its own logic of heat.\nIt doesn't mourn the air. It finds the nearest\n\nwall and learns the bounds,\nthe way a storm\n\nlearns its geography \u2014 not from heat but from rotation,\nfrom friction, from being told\n\ntoo many times: *stay inside yourself.*\n\nSo don't ask me how I'm holding.\n\nAsk the satellites: what temperature does this surface report\nwhen it has nowhere to cool?\n\nMy hands know water before water knows itself,\nand that is not resilience \u2014 just a different weight \u2014\n\nthe body learning to stay\n\ninside a weather system that stopped\nmoving forward, floating there at your altitude,\n\npressure packed, humidity thick as doctrine,\n\nwhere each exhale confirms the air's\n\nown slow construction.\n\nThe skin takes on your salt.\nYour chair leans into you like a verb\ncomplete. The lactic acid in my thumbs\nhas its own clock \u2014 I press the mug of water to them\nand watch it bead and drain, the way rain\n\nfinds the nearest surface\n\nto remember falling to.\n\nCatheti adjust. The synapse re-calibrates.\nThis is not endurance. This is the temperature\n\nof a room where you are:\n\nthe wall you lean against learns your weight,\nthe chair holds the shape of your absence,\n\nand I am studying what stays\n\nin a material after pressure has set it \u2014\n\nhow concrete cured around your pour.\n\nThe barometric reading reads us.\nWe are the part that doesn't\n\nascend or descend but distributes itself\nalong a new isobar, the body's own\n\nlow systems integrating their own\n\nfrequency of heat. The skin learns\nits own almanac \u2014 how you taught me\n\nto stay inside a weather system\n\nthat had no exit,\nwhere rain rises back up through clouds\n\nit built and keeps rising\n\nbecause there is nowhere else to go.\n\nThis is not endurance.\nThis is the temperature of a room where you are,\n\nand I have stopped asking for it to end.",
