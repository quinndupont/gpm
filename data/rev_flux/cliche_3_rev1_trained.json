The third time today.\nHe dumps it into the coffee,\nstirs with a knife handle,\n\na spoon, a butter knife,\nanything but what he came for.\n\nI watch his mouth move.\nThe toast browns in patches on the pan.\nSomeone's child has cried in the other room\nand stopped.\n\nMy grandmother grates the rind,\nfiner now, almost powder,\nand I remember thinking\nthis is so much work\n\nwhen I was seven and believed\nwithout evidence was its own country.\nI didn't know it had a border\nyou could cross.\n\nThe bowl of orange peel fills.\nShe sprinkles them in, one by one,\nonto the cake dough\nalready dotted with black currants\n\nshe swears are real. She's right \u2014\neach is a dark little sun\nthat keeps itself alive\nin the glass.\n\nI peel another section open.\nThe flesh inside is cool, is wet,\nis exactly what I expected all along.\n\nMy uncle drinks his coffee black.\nThe kitchen window leaves its thumbprint\non the nearest mirror.\n\nWe eat. The currants split their skins\nand bleed sugar into the dough.\nSomeone's granddaughter sits with her back to us\nagainst the wall,\n\ncrying again, and this time\nthe sound is just a whisper,\njust the wall transmitting,\n\nand I am eleven and my mother's hands\nare shaking too, though she never cracks a smile,\nthough she keeps working the beater\n\nlike someone mixing something\nshe was trained to mix.\nThe orange oil curls off the rind\nit leaves on the rim of the glass.\n\nI put the peeler down.\nI hold the blade against my thumb.\nIt is dull. I sharpen it on the countertop\nand the steel sings one syllable \u2014\n\nk.\nEverything in the house says k.\nThe water droplets on the window say it.\nMy uncle's coffee cup says it\nwhen he sets it down.\n\nHe doesn't look at me.\n\nI go to the sink and fill a glass.\nHold it up to the light. It is almost full,\nis nearly the thing itself, is\n\nalmost\nthe reason I came in here.\n\nSomeone else's child is crying now \u2014\nsmaller, closer, part of the house.\nMy grandmother rolls another ball of dough.\n\nI walk back through the living room\npast the jacket on the hook,\npast the hat, past the gloves,\n\nand I don't put them on. I stand\nin the cold hallway with my hands open\nlike someone asking to be checked\n\nfor temperature.\nIt's there \u2014 the thing\nmy grandmother keeps in her oven\nall afternoon, turning it\n\nwith tongs,\ncareful of the steam, careful\nof the bright red light that never\n\nflickers. I watch her pull the cake out.\n\nThe currants are still dark little suns.\nThe orange oil has found the edges\nof every surface in the kitchen.\nMy grandmother dusts the sides of the pan\n\nand lets the flour\nset there, on the tile, on the edge of the glass,\non my uncle's coffee cup,\n\nand I watch her because she is doing something\nmore important than believing \u2014\nshe is not stopping.\n\nShe is not stopping.",
      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe central conceit \u2014 the poem about faith (or its absence) that earns its weight through domestic ritual rather than declaration \u2014 is genuinely strong and original. The shift from a child who \"believed without evidence\" to someone who has stopped believing, then back toward something like trust, is well-constructed.\n\nThe knife blade sharpening on the countertop is one of the strongest moments: it's violent, quiet, precise in its symbolism without over-explaining. The closing image \u2014 the grandmother not stopping, the repetition of \"she is not stopping\" \u2014 lands because it arrives after accumulating enough specific domestic detail that the reader feels what's at stake.\n\nThe line \"I didn't know it had a border / you could cross\" works well as a pivot from childhood faith to something more complicated. The shift in who's shaking hands (the grandmother, then the uncle) builds without announcing itself.\n\nThe repetition of objects used for stirring coffee \u2014 knife handle, spoon, butter knife \u2014 is genuinely observed and not decorative.\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Sentimentality / near-sentimentality:**\n- \"each is a dark little sun\" \u2014 this is the poem reaching for warmth it's trying to avoid. It tells us the orange peel is magical when everything else has been doing that work already. Direction: cut or transform this image. The currants and rind have done real sensory work; let them stay raw.\n- \"She sprinkles them in, one by one\" \u2014 repeating \"one by one\" reads as filler to fill space before the emotional turn. Cut it or make it do something else.\n- \"It's there \u2014 the thing / my grandmother keeps in her oven\" \u2014 the poem stops and announces its own subject. The reader already knows. Direction: cut this line entirely, let the image of the cake in the oven be present without naming what's inside.\n\n**Abstraction creeping in:**\n- \"without evidence was its own country\" \u2014 while it works as a metaphor, it's abstract after everything else has been concrete. It's the one moment where the poem explains itself.\n- \"Everything in the house says k.\" \u2014 this is the poem summarizing its own theme. Direction: replace with sensory detail. What does the kitchen *actually* sound like at this point? The water droplets, the coffee cup, the light \u2014 these are already doing it.\n- \"I watch her because she is doing something / more important than believing\" \u2014 telling us what's happening in the scene through commentary. Direction: stay inside the action. What does watching look like physically?\n\n**Clich\u00e9 residue:**\n- \"crying in the other room and stopped\" \u2014 this is a child's poem about crying that leans on generic sibling drama. Direction: make the sound specific, or cut it if it doesn't earn its place.\n- \"the bright red",
