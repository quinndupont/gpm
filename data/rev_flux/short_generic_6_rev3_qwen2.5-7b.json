Consider merging these into one sentence or adjusting the flow to maintain the rhythm.\n   \n2. **Clich\u00e9 Phrases:**\n   - The phrase \"soft couch\" (line 8) is somewhat clich\u00e9d, as it evokes traditional imagery of comfort and rest rather than digital space.\n\n3. **Rhyme Scheme Issues:**\n   - The rhyme scheme does not match the expected ABAB CDCD EFEF GG form.\n     - Line 3: \"beats\" should rhyme with \"keys.\"\n     - Line 4: \"sheets\" should rhyme with \"skies.\"\n     - Line 7: \"flow\" should rhyme with \"posts.\"\n     - Line 8: \"couch\" should rhyme with \"slow.\"\n     - Line 11: \"hype\" should rhyme with \"spans.\"\n     - Line 12: \"tapestry\" should rhyme with \"vanishes.\"\n     - Line 14: \"escape\" should rhyme with \"accelerates.\"\n\n### Directions:\n- **Line Breaks:** Consider merging lines 3 and 4 into one sentence to maintain the flow of digital interaction.\n- **Clich\u00e9 Phrases:** Replace \"soft couch\" with a more fitting metaphor for digital spaces, such as \"digital cushion.\"\n- **Rhyme Scheme:** Revise the rhymes to fit the expected ABAB CDCD EFEF GG scheme. For example:\n  - Line 3: Change \"beats\" to \"keeps\" (rhymes with \"keys\").\n  - Line 4: Change \"sheets\" to \"heavens\" (rhymes with \"skies\").\n  - Line 7: Change \"flow\" to \"slowly\" (rhymes with \"posts\").\n  - Line 8: Change \"couch\" to \"hours\" (rhymes with \"slow\").\n  - Line 11: Change \"hype\" to \"depths\" (rhymes with \"spans\").\n  - Line 12: Change \"tapestry\" to \"threads\" (rhymes with \"vanishes\").\n  - Line 14: Change \"escape\" to \"pace\" (rhymes with \"accelerates\").\n\n### Revised Draft:\nIn cyber realms, where fingers dance on keys,\nTime shifts like shadows under digital skies.\nNo hands turn clocks; instead, screens sync keeps,\nWhere moments blur in endless bytes and heavens.\n\nFacebook frames life in shared likes and posts,\nEach second ticks through pixels, fast or slowly.\nNot love",
