      "critique": "### What Works\n\n- **Tactile and Auditory Imagery:** The lines \"Rain sobs low on cracked streets\" and \"downpipes wail like mourners' cries\" effectively use sound to create a vivid, emotional scene.\n- **Emotional Depth:** Phrases such as \"its weighty sighs resonate with old stories\" convey the city\u2019s history and the rain's role in it.\n\n### Issues\n\n1. **Rhyme Scheme:**\n   - **Deviation from Expected Rhyme Scheme:** The poem does not follow the expected ABAB pattern, which disrupts the intended rhythmic flow.\n     - **Direction:** Revise lines to fit a consistent ABAB or tercet structure. For example:\n       - Line 3: \"Each drop, a finger probing, seeking / to mend or perhaps only deepen scars.\"\n       - Line 4: \"to mend or perhaps only deepen scars / with every touch, it seeks to heal.\"\n     - **Direction:** Ensure that the revised lines maintain the poem\u2019s emotional and sensory focus.\n\n2. **Meter:**\n   - **Variation from Iambic Meter:** The meter varies significantly, which can make the reading less smooth.\n     - **Direction:** Adjust the meter by ensuring each line has a consistent number of syllables and feet. For example:\n       - Line 1: \"Rain sobs low on cracked streets / moisture seeping into fissures deep.\"\n       - Line 2: \"Each drop, a finger probing, seeking / to mend or perhaps only deepen scars.\"\n\n3. **Weak Line Breaks:**\n   - **Line 7:** \"The city breathes wet and heavy\u2014\"\n     - **Direction:** Consider breaking the line after \"wet\" instead of at the dash:\n       - \"The city breathes wet, and heavy\u2014\"\n\n4. **Clich\u00e9 Avoidance:**\n   - **Potential Clich\u00e9s:** The phrase \"promises life yet hushes death\" could be seen as a clich\u00e9.\n     - **Direction:** Refine this line to something more original:\n       - \"promises renewal while cradling the end.\"\n\n5. **Sentimentality:**\n   - **Line 19:** \"Through wet lenses, past and present blur\u2014\"\n     - **Direction:** This line feels somewhat sentimental. Consider a more direct or sensory description:\n       - \"Through wet lenses, time blurs into one.\"\n\n### Revised Draft\n\n- **What Works:** The tactile and auditory imagery remains strong.\n- **Issues Addressed:**\n  - Rhyme scheme adjusted to fit an ABAB pattern.\n  - Meter standardized with consistent iambic foot usage.\n  - Line breaks improved for better flow.\n  - Clich\u00e9s and sentimentality refined.\n\n---\n\n**Revised Poem**\n\nRain sobs low on cracked streets,\nmoisture seeping into fissures deep.\nEach drop, a finger probing,",
