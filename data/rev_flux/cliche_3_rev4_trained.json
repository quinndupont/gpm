      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe structural move \u2014 undressing the scarf as a way to open someone physically, not just unwrap a gift \u2014 is genuinely compelling and earns its weight across the final twelve lines. The closing image of frost \"shattered in the yard\" and \"swallowed whole\" has real compression; it does what \"almost\" achieves elsewhere through vagueness.\n\nThe sensory detail of breath on glass (\"warm as water on glass\") works because it's specific to this scene, not a stock winter image. \"My thumb leaves a crease across your wrist\" is the strongest single line \u2014 concrete, physical, and emotionally loaded without needing to say so.\n\nThe shift from landscape (frost, stove) into intimate body-heat (\"pilot light,\" \"warm as water on glass\") then back out again creates a real arc. The poem knows what it's doing with its architecture: in/out/in.\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Clich\u00e9 / dead language (line 1):**\n> Your scarf is a bird\n> caught under my thumb\u2014\n\nThis is the opening gambit, and it collapses into stock imagery almost immediately. \"A bird caught under someone's thumb\" is vintage children's illustration \u2014 the poem is better off avoiding this register entirely.\n\n**Direction:** Start inside the scene: hands, fingers, wool. The bird metaphor doesn't earn its place until later; putting it first makes everything after it feel like a response to a setup that reads as borrowed furniture.\n\n---\n\n**Line 25-34 (abstraction and sentimentality):**\n> Cold is the last thing\n> we give to each other here.\n>\n> It tastes like December\n> and a promise no one\n> has to keep\u2014just hold,\n> the way I'm holding this scarf\n> after you've left it on\n> the hook, after your coat\n> hangs heavy over my shoulders\n> and I can still smell\n> the pine. The braid of it.\n> The needle and thread\n> of what you didn't say.\n\n*The poem is doing less here than saying it. \"It tastes like December\" names the feeling instead of rendering it.*\n\n**Direction:** Cut or radically compress this passage. Trust the coat on shoulders, trust the pine smell \u2014 these are already present. What's missing is a single concrete image that does what \"the needle and thread / of what you didn't say\" tries to do through abstraction: make silence physical. Replace with one thing.\n\n---\n\n**Line 27-30 (abstraction):**\n> It tastes like December\n> and a promise no one\n> has to keep\u2014just hold,\n\n*This reads as the poet narrating their own feeling about the scene rather than being inside the scene.*\n\n**Direction:** Delete entirely. The poem is stronger without it.\n\n---\n\n**Line 31-32 (re",

      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n---\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe structural architecture is sound: the poem opens in warmth, moves outward into domestic landscape (frost on glass, stove ticking), then narrows back to hands and body \u2014 and that return earns its weight because it was first established with sufficient detail.\n\n**Lines 3\u20135:** \"I pull the skein taut across my knees\" / \"each loop holding like a word held back\" \u2014 this is where the poem's central conceit (knots as withheld words) lands on the page with real force. The simile works because it stays grounded in physical sensation.\n\n**Lines 15\u201320:** Frost as writing on glass (\"etched into the glass: not pretty, just clear\") and the stove ticking \u2014 these are concrete details that build a specific domestic scene without editorializing. \"The tick / keeps time with something under your coat\" is genuinely strong: the poem stops explaining and lets the reader fill in.\n\n**Lines 25\u201330:** The dog barking below, sound sealed by the door, teeth ground into muzzle \u2014 this is the strongest passage of the draft because it commits to sensory containment. Frost swallowing rail, hook, coat \"still hanging\" \u2014 each noun is earned through preceding detail.\n\nThe closing image (thumb leaving crease) returns where it began and closes cleanly.\n\n---\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Clich\u00e9 / dead language (line 1):**\n> My thumb rides the crease of your wrist\u2014\n\nThis opening line borrows posture from a greeting card (\"my thumb rides\") and the \"crease\" reference is too decorative \u2014 it reads as if reaching for something ornamental before anything has been established. The bird metaphor that follows compounds this by positioning the poem as illustration rather than lived experience.\n\n**Direction:** Cut or radically rework lines 1\u20133. Start with what's actually happening: cold hands on warm skin, a parent undressing a child's gift. Let the posture emerge naturally from the scene \u2014 don't frame it as display.\n\n---\n\n**Line 7 (abstraction):**\n> each loop holding like a word held back,\n> like something tied shut rather than cut.\n\n*The poem is explaining its own metaphor here.*\n\n**Direction:** Cut entirely, or compress into one image that does what \"held back\" and \"tied shut\" state. The scarf-as-knots concept should arrive through action, not commentary on itself.\n\n---\n\n**Line 13 (abstraction):**\n> Your name\n> etched into the glass\n> the way cold etches into glass: not pretty,\n> just clear.\n\n*This is the poet narrating what cold does.*\n\n**Direction:** Remove \"not pretty\" \u2014 let the image do its own work. The poem already knows this is about plainness over decoration; cut the editorial voice.\n\n---\n\n**Line 17 (abstraction):",

Frost\ndrew its thin mouth across the sill\nand I traced your name there\u2014no etching,\njust white edge where glass met air.\n\nStove ticks.
