      "draft": "In the soft whisper of dawn, he stirs,\nA gentle hand on your shoulder, warm and true.\nOutside, trees tremble in a light breeze,\nTheir leaves, like whispered secrets underfoot.\n\nBreakfast quiet, shared between toast's aroma\u2014\nThe buttery yellow spread with care, his thumb.\nSlices too big for the plate, a lesson on patience.\nTeaching you to savor each bite as he does.\n\nIn the garden, weeds spring from silent soil,\nLike shadows that dare. He kneels beside them,\nFingers tracing their stubborn roots. A task\nOf patient hands and steady resolve\u2014like his own.\n\nAt dusk's edge, a shadow grows longer by your side.\nHis voice murmurs stories of fields and far-off lands,\nWhere secrets are whispered to the wind, where dreams\nAre nurtured in the cradle of the earth\u2019s embrace.\n\nEach day a tapestry woven with threads of light,\nFrom morning dew on blades to evening fireflies\u2019 dance\u2014\nA life lived not just grandly but gently, quietly.\nFor it is in these small moments his essence lies.",
      "critique": "What's Alive:\n- The sensory details of nature and domestic settings effectively evoke the father\u2019s presence.\n- The imagery of small, everyday actions provides a nuanced portrayal of his role.\n- The enjambment captures the fluidity of daily life.\n\nIssues:\n1. **Weak Line Breaks**: Some lines feel too long or lack necessary breaks to emphasize key moments. For example, \"Outside, trees tremble in a light breeze\" could be split into two lines: \"Outside, / Trees tremble in a light breeze.\"\n2. **Abstraction**: The poem leans towards abstract concepts without concrete examples. For instance, the line \u201cA task of patient hands and steady resolve\u2014like his own\u201d is somewhat vague.\n3. **Sentimentality**: The tone can feel overly sentimental at times, which might detract from the authenticity of everyday moments.\n\nDirections:\n- Break lines more frequently to emphasize key actions and transitions. For example: \"Outside, / Trees tremble in a light breeze.\"\n- Replace abstract phrases with specific examples. Instead of \u201cA task of patient hands and steady resolve\u2014like his own,\u201d consider something like: \u201cHe kneels beside them, / Fingers tracing their stubborn roots, / Patient as the earth\u2019s embrace.\u201d\n- Reduce emotional language to maintain a more grounded tone. For instance, change \"savor each bite\" to \"taste each bite carefully.\"\n\nWhen these changes are implemented and the poem reads with a more balanced blend of imagery and action, this poem has found its shape.",
