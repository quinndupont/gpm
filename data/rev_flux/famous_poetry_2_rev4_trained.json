      "draft": "At two in the morning the house drops\nits last weight of being.\n\nHe hears it first\u2014the hum, a girl's\nparticular pitch curving through the walls,\nhigher than any refrigerator, lower\nthan anyone's concern. It sits\ninside the frequency of old basements,\nthe air vibrating each loose plank\nin its cold mouth.\n\nHe doesn't move for hours. The dog\nsleeps on his side, stomach down,\nmouth open, teeth barely touching\nthe carpet. He could wake her.\nHe could speak the name. But something\u2014\nnot courage, not duty, just the way\na wall holds still once you stop shouting at it\u2014\nkeeps him\n\nThe raven doesn't arrive until the girl's note\nhas dropped to its final dent in the air,\nuntil even that vibration falters\nand goes. He waits longer yet.\n\nThen he hears the real thing\u2014a knock, or rather,\nthe particular tremor of wood hit hard enough\nto resonate with what's left\nin a room full of absence.\nIt lands on the wall near his open window\nand sits there, black as something\nhe has stopped naming, and listens.\n\nThe dog stirs. He can see her silhouette\nin the hall\u2014she always knows,\nhas known since infancy that certain pitches\nare instructions, not music. But she doesn't\ncome to him. She stands in the corridor\nbetween rooms, still as an antenna,\nand what he feels is not grief so much\nas the particular pressure of being heard\nat exactly the wrong hour by someone\nwho can't help themselves.\n\nThe raven tilts its head\u2014the way a tuning fork\nshifts before finding the right note\u2014\nand takes in the pitch without producing it.\nThat is nevermore. It isn't repetition,\nit's absorption. The bird has no use for words\nbut has learned this one\nthe way an antenna learns a signal:\nby stillness, by giving the wave\nroom to enter.\n\nHe doesn't say her name. He barely breathes.\nThe dog lies back down but keeps her ear\ntuned toward the window\u2014animal\ndiscrimination: what belongs to listening,\nwhat belongs to waiting to be told\nto stop.\n\nOutside, a train moves through the yards\nfive miles away. Its sound is not the girl's.\nIt is just sound. But he hears it\nas vibration traveling through everything,\ntrain and rail and every basement in town\nand the particular floor under his bed\nwhere she used to press her ear to the wall\nand laugh at how silly that was,\nhow stupidly\n\nThe raven doesn't move until after\nthe train has finished. Then it turns\nits head toward him, which is remarkable\u2014\na bird that can turn its attention like that\u2014\nand he understands: this isn't about repeating.\nThis is about standing inside a frequency\nso long the body forgets it's a body,\nso long the note becomes\nthe room becomes\nindistinguishable from whatever\nkept singing after all the houses fell quiet.\n\nHe closes his eyes. The dog shifts weight.\nSomewhere in the building a pipe\njunctures, holds its breath, lets go\u2014\na small sound with no source he's learning\nto call weather.\n\nThe raven doesn't speak again.\nIt sits on the sill and waits for whatever\ncomes next in the pitch of things.",
      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe dog passages are the strongest writing here. \"Mouth open, teeth barely touching / the carpet\" \u2014 that detail earns its place because it doesn't announce grief; it just shows a body in bed with one eye on the world. The raven arrives only after the train has passed: this temporal ordering is genuinely effective and trusts silence more than any line of explanation could.\n\nThe final pipe passage works because it does what the poem's central conceit \u2014 sound traveling between worlds \u2014 actually looks like in lived experience. A building's plumbing holding its breath, then letting go: that's not metaphor for grief; that *is* a thing happening to someone who already lives inside this logic. The dog's ear \"tuned toward the window\" is also precise and quiet.\n\nThe poem knows what it's about in its bones \u2014 sound as independent of consciousness \u2014 and mostly stays true to that instinct.\n\n---\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Overextension / Prose Sentences (lines 13\u201328, especially).** The draft loses control around the raven's arrival. \"She always knew, has known since infancy that certain pitches / are instructions, not music\" \u2014 this is exposition burying the poem alive. It tells us what to feel before the bird even speaks. Direction: cut or rewrite entirely into image. What does she *do*? Stay with the dog standing in the corridor.\n\n**Abstraction and sentimentality (lines 29\u201336).** \"Particular pressure of being heard / at exactly the wrong hour by someone / who can't help themselves\" \u2014 this is the poem explaining its own emotional stakes. The raven's stillness has already done that work. Direction: remove entirely. Let the bird's posture carry what the line states.\n\n**Clich\u00e9 and stock language (throughout).** \"Drops its last weight of being,\" \"particular pitch curving through the walls,\" \"still as an antenna,\" \"tuned to a frequency.\" These are the poem reaching for elegance where it should be reaching for strangeness. Direction: every phrase needs to be tested against what the dog and raven know. If it's ornamental, it isn't part of this world.\n\n**Tonal inconsistency (lines 37\u201346).** \"How stupidly\" \u2014 the poem drops into a voice that undermines its own seriousness. The closing three lines shift register without justification. Direction: end on something as quiet and definitive as the train passage. Trust the raven's silence to close the whole piece.\n\n**Line breaks (throughout, but especially 29\u201336).** Lines break at syntactic joints with no tension \u2014 \"so much / how stupidly\" \u2014 which deflates. Direction: try breaking mid-phrase to create suspension before the next line arrives.\n\n---\n\n### Revision Guidance\n\nThe draft has found",

  "final_poem": "At two the house\ndrops its last weight.\n\nHe hears it\u2014\nnot hum but drop,\neach loose plank\nshaking its cold tooth.\n\nThe dog sleeps\non her stomach, mouth open,\nher ear tuned toward the window.\n\nWhen even that has dropped,\nthe raven arrives,\nperches on the sill\u2014black\nas something he's stopped naming\u2014and listens.\n\nOutside, five miles from yards,\na train moves through and its sound is not her,\nit is just sound\u2014but he hears it\nas vibration traveling: rail and basement wall,\nthe floor under his bed where she pressed her ear once,\nlaughing at how silly that was, how stupidly.\n\nThe raven tilts its head\nthe way a tuning fork shifts\u2014\nabsorbing without producing.\nThat is nevermore.\nJust stillness room inside him\nwhere the note becomes the room becomes\nindistinguishable from what kept singing after all houses quieted.\n\nHe barely breathes. The dog keeps her ear tuned.\nSomewhere in the building a pipe junctures,\nholds its breath, lets go\u2014a small sound with no source\nhe's learning to call weather.\n\nThe raven sits and waits for whatever\ncomes next in the pitch of things.\n\nOutside: the coupler releasing, the latches seizing,\neach car catching like a breath held mid-sentence.\n\nHe stands when it is lighter than it was.\nThe dog still sleeps on her stomach, mouth open,\nher ear tuned toward the window.\n\nHer old skirt hangs on the chair back.\nHe doesn't move it. The kitchen light\nis its own small train\u2014engine, then nothing,\nthen only the black oil track it left\nacross the table where she rested hers once.\n\nThe raven has gone. When a bird returns to a perch\nit's not the same as when it leaves. The sill\nholds the shape of what was there.\n\nThrough the window: morning\npressing its thin fingers against the glass,\neach one a rail separating dark from darker.\nA truck moves down the block, its undercarriage\nticking like a sternum beating out a generation's\nidea of frequency\u2014*listen*\nand the floor beneath his bed shifts\nthe way plaster bends toward water.\n\nHe doesn't stand for her. He stands\nfor the house's smallest nerve\nstill finding what it was made to find,\nwhich is why he can hear\na faucet dripping three buildings over\nwhile the dog sleeps on her stomach, mouth open,\nher ear tuned toward the window.",
