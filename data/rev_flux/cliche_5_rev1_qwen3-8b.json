      "critique": "**What\u2019s alive:**  \nThe metaphor of hands as a forge and lighthouse is vivid and original. The rhythm of daily labor is mirrored in trochaic/iambic cadence, and enjambment stretches moments like the storm\u2019s \u201ccracks its throat.\u201d The contrast between quiet acts and their impact (e.g., \u201ca stitch here, a whisper there\u201d) is subtle but effective. The closing lines, \u201ca legacy written in the language of holding,\u201d tie the poem\u2019s themes together with precision.  \n\n**Issues:**  \n- **Clich\u00e9**: \u201cA thousand small miracles\u201d feels overused; replace with a more specific, concrete phrase (e.g., \u201ca thousand small acts\u201d).  \n- **Abstraction**: \u201cThe house hums\u201d and \u201cdays fold\u201d are vague; ground these in sensory details (e.g., \u201cthe house hums with the hum of wires,\u201d \u201cdays fold into the creases of his hands\u201d).  \n- **Weak line break**: The line \u201cHis palms, weathered maps of all the things / he\u2019s carried",
