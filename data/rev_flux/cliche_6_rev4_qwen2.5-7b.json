      "draft": "In the whispering hush, they sit,\nA room of muted colors\u2014soft whispers, faded light.\nMarble floors cold beneath bare feet,\nCrisp air filled with distant incense, a forgotten ritual.\n\nHer dress clings like an old memory,\nSilken threads catching stray dust motes on their way.\nHe leans forward slightly, hand resting lightly on the chair\u2019s armrest,\nFingers tracing patterns as if seeking something lost in time.\n\nEyes lock, but not of two stars at night\u2014\nRather, a journey into the crevices of the past, each glance a voyage uncharted.\nShe thinks: the library where hands trembled with forgotten stories;\nThe caf\u00e9 corner where whispered confessions lingered like smoke.\nHe recalls: the park benches under trees whispering secrets,\nAnd quiet corners where shadows danced in soft, flickering lamplight.\n\nTheir breaths sync in a dance unseen by others\u2014\nA shared scent of aged books and old photographs.\nHands twitch, fingers tap on laps or desks, restless with remembered touches.\nEach blink is a door opening to chambers long unvisited:\nRooms filled not just with light but the echoes of laughter, tears, and soft confidences.\n\nIn these eyes, they meet not as strangers\u2014\nBut travelers returning from distant lands, eager to recount their voyages.",
      "critique": "What's Alive:\n- The vivid sensory details of the room, such as \"soft whispers, faded light,\" and \"distant incense.\"\n- The metaphorical journey through memories via eye contact.\n- The use of enjambment to create a fluid sense of connection.\n\nIssues (Type, Location, Direction):\n1. **Weak Line Breaks**: Lines 4-5 and 6-7 have weak breaks that disrupt the flow and can obscure meaning. Consider breaking lines at \"dust motes\" and \"lost in time.\"\n2. **Clich\u00e9 Phrases**: The phrase \"whispering hush\" is a clich\u00e9, which detracts from the originality of the poem. Try something more specific or evocative.\n3. **Overly Descriptive Sentences**: Lines 10-14 are overly descriptive and can be simplified without losing meaning. For example, \"She thinks: the library where hands trembled with forgotten stories\" could be streamlined to focus on key details.\n\nDirections:\n1. Revise line breaks in lines 4-5 and 6-7.\n2. Replace \"whispering hush\" with a more specific description of the atmosphere, such as \"the barely audible hum.\"\n3. Simplify and tighten lines 10-14 to focus on key sensory details and emotions.\n\nWhen done:\nThis poem has found its shape.",
