Your face did not find me either,\nexactly, it found something behind my shoulder,\nsome projection I could not see.\nThe faucet dripped. The refrigerator\nhummed its low numeral. And somewhere\nin the building a glass of water sat\non a windowsill, gathering dust\nthe way memory gathers dust before it becomes\nthe kind of thing we carry like a room.\n\nI stood there with my ordinary hands.\nThey knew. They knew everything\nabout what would not be said,\nabout how you were holding something\nin the same way I held the banister\ngoing down a stairwell once, and neither of us\nmentioned it because mentioning it\nwould have meant naming the chair\nwe both remembered sitting in.\n\nThe vein in your cheek moved.\nNot toward me \u2014 perpendicular,\na small meteor doing its\nbrilliant thing above floorboards\nat two in the morning when no one needs anything,\nand that is when I saw it:\nhow the light was not on you but through you,\nhow you were not the subject\nbut the aperture, the hole\nin a wall of time from which\nsomething else had returned \u2014 the sound\nof a door shut once, long ago,\nthe kind of closing you can't unhear.\n\nI put my hands in my pockets.\nThey were already there. They'd been there\nsince I walked out, which was before I walked out,\nwhich was while I was still standing\nin the doorway holding the ordinary thing\nthat is a key, and the lock, and the moment\nbefore you name it \u2014 which is everything.",
      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### What's Alive\n\nThe structural conceit \u2014 the gap between what the speaker *sees* and what they *remember* \u2014 is genuinely strong. The poem earns its tension by keeping those two registers almost entirely separate: the world of the body (ordinary hands, a kitchen table) and the world of memory (a specific gesture on a specific day in a place called \"Something Else\"). That gap does more work than any single image.\n\nThe closing three lines land with real force. \"I put my hands in my pockets. / They were already there.\" \u2014 the nesting of past tense (\"had been there\" \u2192 \"were there\") enacts the way memory retroactively organizes experience. The final two lines, which name nothing but gesture everything: \"a key, and the lock, and the moment / before you name it\" \u2014 that's where the poem earns its title.\n\nThe kitchen table detail (bent at thirty degrees) is precise enough to feel like a single observed moment. It doesn't explain itself; that restraint serves the poem well.\n\n### What Isn't Working\n\n**Sentimentality / Over-explanation (lines 31\u201340):** The middle section collapses into paraphrase and summary, which undermines what the first half built through image alone. \"A glass of water sat / on a windowsill, gathering dust / the way memory gathers dust before it becomes / the kind of thing we carry like a room.\" \u2014 this is the poem *telling* us that memory is dusty and heavy. Cut or replace with another concrete particular. The poem already showed us dust accumulating in line 27 (\"gathering dust\"). That image doesn't need to be named \"memory.\"\n\n**Abstraction (lines 31\u201334):** \"My hands were not doing anything. / They sat in my lap like two ordinary cups.\" \u2014 this is the speaker *telling* us their hands are ordinary before naming them as extraordinary. Direction: cut or replace with a physical gesture that doesn't need commentary.\n\n**Redundancy (lines 27\u201330):** \"A glass of water sat / on a windowsill, gathering dust / the way memory gathers dust before it becomes / the kind of thing we carry like a room.\" \u2014 this is three images doing one job. Direction: choose one. The poem already has enough water/dust imagery.\n\n**Clich\u00e9 (line 24):** \"fingers tightening around the seam / of nothing\" \u2014 \"nothing\" as abstract placeholder kills the specificity the rest of the line builds toward. Name something. Direction: replace with a concrete absence, whatever it actually is.\n\n**Weak transition (lines 19\u201320):** \"And somewhere / in the building a glass of water sat\" \u2014 \"somewhere\" is doing nothing but creating vagueness where precision is needed. Direction: name the location or cut entirely; this line",

My hands sat in my lap\nlike two ordinary cups.\n\nFingers tightened around nothing, just inside\nthe softest seam where skin could listen,\nand there was a faucet dripping, and somewhere\nin that building a glass of water sat\non a shelf of windowsill, gathering dust\nthe way memory gathers dust before it becomes\nwhat we carry like a room\u2014a particular room.\n\nI stood with my hands in my pockets.\nThey'd been there since I walked out,\nwhich was while I was still standing\nin the doorway holding the ordinary thing\nthat is a key, and the lock, and that moment\nbefore you name it\u2014 which is everything.\n\nYou turned. Your face found something behind me,\nnot me, some projection on the wall.\nThe faucet dripped its single note.\nYour left cheek moved\u2014a small meteor\nabove floorboards at two in the morning,\nwhen no one needs anything except the thing\nthat has no name yet carries weight like a banister\nin a stairwell I remember going down,\nyour thumb bent at thirty degrees, steady.\n\nI watched you and understood: how light\nwas not on you but through you\u2014the way\nyou held a door once, years ago,\nand didn't close it all the way\u2014\nthe hinge still whispering its open mouth.\n\nYour hands were empty. Mine were too.\nWe stood like that in a kitchen\nwhere nothing needed tending. The refrigerator\nhummed its low frequency, and I could see\nhow you'd been holding something\u2014\nnot tightly, not loosely\u2014while setting down\na cup of coffee on the counter,\nyour thumb bent at thirty degrees,\nthe way yours was now on the table's edge.\n\nI let myself be seen. You didn't turn fully.\nYou kept looking past me toward a window\nthat wasn't there, and I held still\nthe way you hold a door\u2014\nnot closing it, not opening wider\u2014\njust standing in the angle you'd made,\nand somewhere underneath that angle\nthe banister gave way and everything\nwe both remembered flooded back: the basement,\nthe mudroom coat hooks, the particular Monday\nyou laughed so hard you gripped the banister\nand didn't let go.\n\nYour thumb was still bent. Mine too.\nWe stood like that\u2014the way you hold a door\u2014\nuntil the faucet finished its small\narithmetic, and silence filled the kitchen\nbetween us, which was not silence either,\nwhich was the room we'd both kept from closing.",
      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### What's Alive\n\nThe structural architecture \u2014 a present scene where the speaker sees one thing and remembers another, two parallel realities running in parallel tracks until they converge \u2014 is genuinely strong. The closing three lines (\"I put my hands in my pockets. / They were already there\") work because the nesting of past tenses does real cognitive work: memory retroactively rewrites what happened before it existed.\n\nThe thirty-degree bend in a thumb (line 5) and the banister moment (lines 32\u201334, revisited) are precise observations that earn their weight through specificity. The kitchen table detail is the poem's anchor \u2014 something seen with enough physical clarity to feel like an actual witnessed gesture rather than a generically emotional gesture.\n\nThe refrain of \"bent at thirty degrees\" does real work: it resurfaces as memory, as observed action, and finally as remembered stillness. That single angle carries the whole poem on its shoulder.\n\n### What Isn't Working\n\n**Redundancy / Paraphrase (lines 27\u201334):** The middle section is the poem's weakest stretch. \"A glass of water sat on a windowsill, gathering dust\" appears twice in close succession \u2014 once as image and once as explanation (\"the way memory gathers dust\"). \"The faucet dripped its single note\" arrives again (line 28 \u2192 line 30). The refrigerator humming is repeated as low frequency. Each of these images is doing one job; taken together, they do too little. Direction: **cut or consolidate.** Choose two concrete sensory details from the kitchen and let them stand without commentary.\n\n**Abstraction / Explanation (lines 25\u201327):** \"Fingers tightened around nothing\" \u2014 \"nothing\" as placeholder kills the tension the hand gesture built. Name what's absent, or cut the abstraction entirely. Direction: **replace with a concrete thing not there.**\n\n**Clich\u00e9 / Dead Language (line 16):** \"A small meteor doing its / brilliant thing above floorboards\" \u2014 this is decorative and vague. A meteor on floorboards is an image worth more than it gets here, flattened by the adjective \"brilliant.\" Direction: **cut or replace with a specific observed physical detail.**\n\n**Telling Instead of Showing (lines 21\u201323):** \"The way you held something \u2014 / not tightly, not loosely \u2014 while setting down / a cup of coffee on the counter\" \u2014 this is the speaker narrating their own memory for us. The poem already showed it in line 5 (\"bent at thirty degrees\"). Direction: **cut or compress to one line maximum.**\n\n**Weak Line Breaks (lines 17, 20):** \"not toward me \u2014 perpendicular,\" and \"I saw it:\" \u2014 these breaks create no tension or surprise; they simply end clauses that needed closing anyway. Direction: **",
