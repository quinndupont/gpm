It doesn't stop.\nIt doesn't feel. It just\n\ndemolishes the parking lot into a garden\nwhere the cars rust first\u2014\ntheir paint peeling back like skin,\n\nand underneath is more skin.\nThe grass grows inside the tires.\n\nThere's a method to this madness,\nthough no one asked it:\nthe ruthless undermining of everything\n\nthat has learned to harden, to set,\nto become the sort of thing\nthat resists. Watch how spring\n\ntreats concrete: it softens it\nwith such patience you'd swear\nit was tender, was almost\n\napologetic\u2014until the crack\nspreads through what you thought\nwas final, and nothing stays\n\nwhere you put it. The weed\ndoesn't arrive second.\nIt arrives the only way\n\nanything important arrives:\nby tearing open the first version\n\nof reality and saying,\n *this will do better.*\n\nThe sprinkler head comes up anyway\u2014\nyou can hear its hiss from inside\nthe building, that half-asleep\n\nsound of water trying to\nunmake a yard. But by the time\nsomeone turns it off,\n\nsomething has rooted in the crack\n\nbetween the bricks. It doesn't care\nabout your plan for June.\nIt just keeps going\u2014\n\nthrough the blacktop, through the sewer line,\nthrough the pipe that carries\nwaste and finds no waste now, finds only\n\nground to break apart and swallow.\nThis is not a gentle thing.\n\nThis is the undoing of every seal,\nevery caulk, every bituminous decision\nto hold still. Spring doesn't give a fuck\u2014\n\nit just keeps pushing: root, root,\nroot through the septic tank,\nthrough the house, through the\n\nfounding stone where the ledger book\nused to sit and record who paid\nfor what, and now nothing\n\nrecords because everything is\n\nalready under. The water finds\nits own architecture.\nThe earth splits open like a wound\n\nthat doesn't scar\u2014like a wound that\ndoesn't need to, since it will keep\nopening, keeping\n\neverything inside from being\nstill for one more day. This is not gentle.\nThis is the honest version:\n\na season with no patience for your pipes,\nyour mortgages, your concrete, your\n\nbelief in what you built and\nhow long it would last. It comes\nwith its own undoing\u2014\n\nand you can either watch\n\nor get out of the way before\n\nthe next thing it undoes\nis something you were\n\nholding onto without realizing\nyou'd stopped being alive for.",
      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe poem has a genuine engine in its central conceit: spring as entropy, destruction without malice or purpose \u2014 \"no wantonness\" except the wantonness of inevitability. The line \"the ground cracks open like a stomachache / and what comes out is not green / but the purest wantonness\" earns its place because it resists easy categorization: this violence is unpremeditated, which makes it stranger.\n\nThe image of grass growing inside tires \u2014 that's precise, surprising, and does real work. The weed arriving before anyone else, the sprinkler hissing through a closed door, the root pushing through septic pipe: these are observations with teeth. The poem knows what it wants to be in its bones.\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Overcrowded imagery (abstraction and clich\u00e9 risk).** The draft is already close enough that some lines are fighting for attention rather than adding layers. \"White-gooey thing,\" \"skin,\" \"tender, was almost / apologetic\" \u2014 these soften the poem's edge at exactly the moment it should be sharpening it. \"A white-gooey thing that pushes through\" is a sentence fragment dressed as metaphor; it reads like the poet stopped and reached for something. Direction: cut any imagery that could appear in a greeting card or home decor catalog. If you can't explain what the image does \u2014 how it *enacts* spring's indifference rather than describing that indifference \u2014 delete it.\n\n**Sentimentality / rhetorical inflation (lines 23\u201340).** The poem drifts into editorializing: \"it doesn't stop. / It doesn't feel.\" This is the poet narrating their own argument, and it weakens every line around it by making them redundant. \"Watch how spring / treats concrete\" \u2014 this tells us what to see instead of letting the image do its job. Direction: remove any sentence that begins with a pronoun + verb of observation (\"it doesn't,\" \"watch how\"). Trust the images.\n\n**Redundancy.** The poem says \"nothing stays where you put it\" and then says \"everything is already under.\" It says \"keep going\" twice (lines 36\u201337). These are the poet restating what they've already established, which kills momentum. Direction: each image should be a new fact. If the poem returns to ground covered, that repetition must add pressure or shift meaning \u2014 right now it just stalls.\n\n**Line breaks and form.** The line \"the founding stone where the ledger book / used to sit and record who paid\" is syntactically broken in a way that doesn't serve the rhythm or emphasis. It reads as a break for the sake of",
