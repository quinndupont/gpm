      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### What's Alive\n\nThe passage beginning \"My breath, I remember it\" through \"my warmth found a water spot / on glass and left its mark like a thumb / dragged down a name you can't quite read\" \u2014 this is where the poem earns its subject. The breath as something that *does* rather than narrates becomes concrete: fog on glass, a thumb dragging down an unreadable name. \"Fog thickening\" in line 26 also works because it's specific and visual without becoming decorative.\n\nThe floorboard shift at the end (\"a floorboard shifts with nothing on it\") lands as the poem's true closing gesture \u2014 quiet, strange, earned by what came before. The silence there is doing real work.\n\nThe ratio of short lines keeps the poem close to breath itself rather than \"narrative.\" That instinct is sound.\n\n### What Isn't Working\n\n**Sentimentality / emotional over-explanation (lines 17\u201320):**\n\"which is the way memory works \u2014 / not forgetting but requiring obstruction, / the opacity of a lung exhaling cold / into a room that has fallen asleep / and does not hear us, does not care\"\nThis is where the poem stops trusting its own images. \"Opacity of a lung exhaling cold\" was already said (and better) in \"fog on glass.\" The explanatory moral (\"not forgetting but requiring obstruction\") breaks the poem's immersion into abstract summary. **Direction:** Cut or replace with another image. What does that moment actually feel like, physically? The room is already doing this work through its silence and the refrigerator.\n\n**Clich\u00e9 / stock language (line 14):**\n\"they whispered there, those frilly prisons of dust and light\" \u2014 \"whispered,\" \"prisons,\" \"light.\" This is decorative metaphor where plainness was needed. The curtains are doing nothing *but* whispering? That's a claim the image doesn't support on its own terms. **Direction:** Replace with one observed detail about what those curtains actually look like or do at three in the morning.\n\n**Redundancy (lines 12\u201313):**\n\"they nearly touched. They whispered there, / those frilly prisons of dust and light,\" \u2014 \"whispered\" appears twice within two lines. The line break doesn't create enough tension to justify it. **Direction:** Choose one: the near-touch, or the whispering. Let them do double duty.\n\n**Weak transition (line 21):**\n\"Somewhere underneath the house / a floorboard shifts with nothing on it.\" \u2014 \"somewhere underneath\" is vague and deflates the specificity that characterized the poem's best moments. **Direction:** Ground this more. What kind of floor? The basement? A crawl space? Even \"underneath\" could be sharpened.\n\n**Line 23 reads as filler:**\n\"that small percussion",
