      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### What's Alive\n\nThe central conceit \u2014 that absence leaves a trace in water, not as void but as altered pattern \u2014 is genuinely original. The shift from \"the lake held its breath\" (a clich\u00e9) to something like \"water learned to be / slightly less certain / about its own surface\" earns its place: it's specific enough to feel observed rather than invented.\n\nThe marina passage (\"I stood at the marina, / waiting for a slip to open\") is the strongest structural move. The poem arrives there with accumulated pressure and finds something concrete \u2014 tracks in ice where someone sat. That detail does more work than any other line because it's grounded in physical evidence.\n\n\"Untracts itself\" is a striking coinage, precise and surprising at once.\n\nThe closing turn (\"That's what friendship does to water: / it makes it practice / forgetting so well\") lands on the thesis the brief warned against \u2014 but arrives there through enough earned material that the statement still feels like revelation rather than summary. It works as coda.\n\n### What Isn't Working\n\n**Abstraction creep (lines 23\u201326):**\n\"and I understood: this isn't loss.\nThis is how a current\nremembers someone's shape\nby becoming what\ncomes after.\"\nThe poem loses its physical specificity here and slides into explanation. \"Someone's shape\" is vague; \"becoming what comes after\" is pure abstraction. The marina passage already did the work of that paragraph in four lines. Direction: cut or replace with a single image as concrete as fish tracks.\n\n**Clich\u00e9 resurgence (lines 19\u201320):**\n\"the basin re-seamed along your departure line\" \u2014 \"departure line\" is vague and slightly archaic, and \"re-seamed\" recalls fabric or leather rather than water. Direction: find an aquatic verb that doesn't require the seam metaphor.\n\n**Sentimentality (lines 31\u201332):**\n\"when you return\u2014\nwhich you will, though not today\"\nThe poem knows it's trying to avoid sentiment but here it leans on a wish-fulfillment ending (\"you will, though not today\"). The reader is told the beloved will come back; no resistance, no cost. Direction: let the absence persist in the final image or end closer to the water's truth \u2014 its inability to hold anyone permanently.\n\n**Redundancy / refrain weakness (refrain throughout):**\nThe repeated \"the lake/the reservoir\" shifts slightly but not meaningfully enough across appearances to create genuine variation. Each time it arrives, the pressure resets rather than accumulates. Direction: if keeping a refrain, let each return shift the surrounding language enough that recontextualization matters.\n\n**Line 12 (\"I watched from",
