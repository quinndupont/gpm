      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe second half of the draft is where the poem earns its subject: \"No one is singing\" lands with real weight because it contradicts the title and the opening's insistence on frequency \u2014 it *does* sing, but not in a way anyone would call song. The dog barking at nothing and the rattling bed of plastic crates are two of the sharpest images here; they feel observed rather than decorated.\n\n\"A woman peels an orange against the driver's-side window\" is precise, quiet, visual \u2014 it does more work than any other line in the draft because it trusts the image over explanation. The juice \"going everywhere\" earns its place only because it's grounded in something physical and particular.\n\nThe closing three lines (\"quiet / pressing against the seats of our silence\") come closest to articulating what the angle required: that stillness is a pressure, not an absence.\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Abstraction balking the poem at key moments (lines 13\u201316).** \"How lunchtime has its own hum\" \u2014 this is the thesis statement the brief warned against. It names what the images should have done: made us feel that hum without labeling it. Direction: cut or rewrite entirely into something only heard, never named.\n\n**Clich\u00e9 and stock language (pervasive).** \"Metal bodies / idling,\" \"something swallowed\" (personification too easy), \"mouth saying nothing\" (dead metaphor), \"carefully stacked by someone's morning hand\" (furniture of the abstract noun variety). Each one reaches for feeling through a phrase already worn smooth. Direction: interrogate every noun-adjective pairing \u2014 if it could appear in any poem about trucks, it needs replacing with something only *this* parking lot would have.\n\n**The opening is doing too much setup before anything arrives.** Lines 1\u20138 are almost entirely explanation of what the poem means to do rather than what it actually does. \"Has no pitch, no note / but carries the weight\" tells us about the frequency before we've heard it. Direction: begin closer to the orange-peeling or the sandwich-eating \u2014 let the acoustic textures arrive first, then name them if necessary.\n\n**Sentimentality in the close.** The final stanza drifts toward a closing moral (\"how the parking lot / becomes an instrument no one tuned\"). This is the poem *telling* the reader what to feel about silence rather than trusting its own images. Direction: end with the image, not the essay. What does the fluorescent light know that *can't* be said?\n\n**Line breaks are inconsistent and often arbitrary.** \"The fan / above his truck cabinet clicks on warm\" \u2014 \"fan\" alone as a line is hard to justify; it reads as a break for rhythm rather than meaning. \"A man adjusts his belt. The engine settles / into",

      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe dog barking at the brick wall, the bed of plastic crates rattling back into place, and especially the final three lines \u2014 \"like something almost ready / to be heard\" \u2014 are where the poem stops explaining its own subject and starts inhabiting it. The closing gesture earns what came before: a quiet, unannounced ending that lets silence arrive without announcing itself.\n\nThe woman peeling orange against the windowpane is precise, grounded, and trusts the image over commentary. \"Its color goes everywhere \u2014 onto her lap, onto the seat, / and into the air as juice finds its own level\" works because it's concrete and doesn't editorialize about what these details mean.\n\nThe line \"the way water catches a stone: / the stone changes. The water / holds the shape of what it held\" is doing real acoustic thinking \u2014 water holding shape through repetition, changing under pressure. That's the poem's central metaphor working.\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Abstraction and explanation crowding the opening (lines 1\u20138).** \"A frequency only certain fluorescent tubes / settle into after nine in the morning\" is technical without being felt. The reader hasn't heard that frequency before line 9, which means the first eight lines are setup doing what the closing should do \u2014 name the acoustic subject and let it vibrate. Direction: cut or radically compress the opening explanation to arrive at the orange-peeling faster.\n\n**The stanza beginning \"A woman peels\" (lines 7\u201312) is strong but needs tightening around its edges.** \"Juice maps a circle. She wipes it up with a sleeve.\" \u2014 this is good, but \"maps,\" \"wipes it up,\" and the orange-juice juice confusion (line 9) are slightly cluttered. Direction: choose one action or make the juice-tracking imagery cleaner.\n\n**\"The way no one puts their coat across the chair\" (line 20).** This is a clich\u00e9 of observation \u2014 someone's neatness as social fact, not sensory detail. It reads like a greeting-card note about order. Direction: replace with something that *feels* observed rather than filed.\n\n**\"The stone changes.\"** The metaphor works but \"changes\" is too vague compared to the precise water-holding image around it. Direction: stay as specific as the water/stone comparison elsewhere.\n\n**Line breaks are still inconsistent and sometimes arbitrary (lines 16\u201320).** \"No one is singing\" \u2014 a line by itself, but it's doing exposition rather than enjambment work. \"The fluorescent tube keeps its frequency.\" \u2014 this reads as prose broken into lines. Direction: every line break should either create tension or complete a thought in a way only that position can. Read each break aloud and ask whether the next word *wants* to be on its",

It states a thesis the poem has already shown through detail. Direction: cut it entirely. Let the dog barking at the brick wall do this work \u2014 it's more alive and quieter than commentary.\n\n**Line 24: \"The stone changes\" again (redundant).** Direction: remove or replace with something that advances the acoustic argument rather than restating what was said in line 17.\n\n**Lines 13\u201316:** The silver sedan, light, ductwork sequence is strong but the \"thin / silver thread pressed into wax\" simile fogs specificity. Direction: choose one detail from this cluster \u2014 say more about less.\n\n**Line 20: \"The way no one puts their coat across the chair.\"** This is a clich\u00e9 of observation \u2014 someone's neatness as social fact, not sensory detail. It reads like a greeting-card note about order. Direction: replace with something that *feels* observed rather than filed.\n\n**Lines 17\u201320 (the \"stone changes\" passage):** The repetition here flattens the acoustic texture. Direction: compress to two or three lines maximum, let the water image get more screen time.\n\n**Line 9: \"Juice goes everywhere \u2014 onto",
