  "final_poem": "In paths untrodden, under skies of gray  \nI find myself lost within my own dismayed array;   \nA fork in time's relentless march lay before me grand \u2013 a choice to make or break it all:    \nTo take the road less walked on this land. \n\nYet here I stand, paralyzed by fear\u2019 endlessly swings  \nThe weight of impending decisions clinks and rings;   \nA chasm divides where once stood a single tree \u2013 now two diverging roads lay bare within my eyes:    \nOne path leads to uncertainty. \n\nI hesitate, then choose the lesser known route ahead with quiet resolve in heart  \nAs weaved through each bygone year\u2019s silent strife and art;   \nA different road beckons \u2013 one of untold promise filled potential:    \nMy decision felt like a betrayal. \nToday, this choice has gifted me time - an hour I would've otherwise squandered on mundane toil  \nThe humdrum reality that my life once seemed so steep;   \nI find joy in the beauty of unexpected sights before eyes blind:    \nMy heart whispers gratitude for a simpler, kinder fate.",
