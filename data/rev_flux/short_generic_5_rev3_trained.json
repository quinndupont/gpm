February.\nThe radiator ticks its slow count.\n\nYour glasses clean and dry on the kitchen towel,\nthe way you press them with two fingers like a temple.\nCup of coffee gone cold beside the laptop's glow.\nA cardinal hits the feeder, stuns, wings spread\n\nin that strange stillness birds make\nbefore they take flight. You shift your bag\nmore than fasten it. The door handle\ncatches on the loop of your keychain \u2014\nthat small hesitation, almost deliberate,\n\nas if the body were a instrument\ntuned to know its silence. Snow\ndrives itself ahead in the window,\nand the kitchen table holds\n\nits ordinary load: the mail, the phone,\na cactus leaning slightly left.\nYour coat hangs now across the back of the chair.\n\nNo one says anything about saying goodbye.\nThe light is low enough that everything\ngrows a little darker when you turn. The cardinal\nhas flown. The feeder idles clean.\n\nI will keep drinking my coffee black.\nThe card table in the snow outside\nkeeps its compacted shape against nothing.\nYour thumb print on the collar of your coat \u2014\nthat crease, that particular crease\n\na hand knows how to make while walking home,\nwhile thinking about something else entirely.",
      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe poem has a genuine engine in its second half, where the speaker stops narrating and starts remembering through objects. \"Your coat hangs now across the back of the chair\" \u2014 that is the first concrete image after several lines of setup, and it lands with real weight because everything around it stays quiet. The closing three lines (\"the card table in the snow outside / keeps its compacted shape against nothing\") achieve something precise: a small gesture of pressure on emptiness without naming grief.\n\nThe moment where the door handle catches on the keychain \u2014 that hesitation rendered as if deliberate, almost musical \u2014 is earned through context; it does more work than most lines in the poem. And \"a hand knows how to make while walking home, / while thinking about something else entirely\" \u2014 this line earns its abstraction because it arrives after a sustained accumulation of physical detail.\n\nThe enjambment between \"the kitchen table holds\" and its load is doing real structural work: the line break suspends holding as an action. That's good instinct.\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Sentimentality / announced emotion (clich\u00e9 by another name):** The poem repeatedly resists saying \"I miss you,\" but it keeps reaching for substitutes that are still greeting-card language \u2014 \"no one says anything about saying goodbye\" (vague, self-parodic), \"everything / grows a little darker when you turn\" (stock light/dark metaphor). **Direction:** Cut the explanatory frame entirely. The poem doesn't need to tell us what's happening in the speaker's mind before it happens. Trust the objects and gestures.\n\n**Expository setup clogging the opening:** Lines 1\u20138 are mostly background, and they're not all doing different work. \"February,\" \"radiator ticks its slow count\" (a clock metaphor that competes with the later silence), \"cold coffee beside the laptop's glow\" \u2014 these are observations, but they read as a list of things to check off rather than images that build pressure. **Direction:** The coat and thumb print arrive in line 5. Everything before that should be recompressed or replaced with more specific sensory detail that *enacts* the person leaving.\n\n**Clich\u00e9 phrasing surviving scrutiny:** \"That strange stillness birds make / before they take flight\" \u2014 this is a clich\u00e9 dressed in an apostrophe. The cardinal image earlier (lines 7\u20138) was alive; this one replaces it with commentary on the image. **Direction:** Remove the apostrophe entirely, or find a verb that does what \"stillness\" tries to do without naming it.\n\n**Redundancy:** \"Particular\" appears twice in lines close together (\"that particular fold,\" \"that small hesitation, almost deliberate\"). The word is doing no new work each time. **Direction:** Choose one instance and make the modifier earn its place with more specificity.\n\n",

      "critique": "## Revision Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe second half of the poem is where this draft finally earns its premise: lines 23\u201328, and especially the closing three lines. \"A hand knows how to make while walking home\" \u2014 that line does what the whole poem should do: it stays in physical memory without explaining itself. The final image of the table compacted against nothing is genuinely small, specific, and strange enough to land as a gesture toward absence.\n\nThe coat on the chair (lines 20\u201321) also works because it arrives late \u2014 after enough detail has accumulated that its absence registers with real weight.\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Redundancy / structural bloat:** The poem says almost exactly the same thing twice, and the second version is weaker. Lines 5\u20138 (the crease, the thumb, February, radiator) are essentially repeated in lines 13\u201316 with \"while thinking about something else entirely\" tacked on as a deflationary clause. **Direction:** Cut or compress everything before line 20. The poem's engine is its second half; it doesn't need to warm up twice.\n\n**Expository filler (lines 9\u201312):** \"A cactus leaning slightly left,\" \"the mail, the phone\" \u2014 these are catalog items that add nothing specific. They pad the scene without sharpening any image. **Direction:** Choose one object and interrogate it with the same precision as the coat and thumb. The cactus is doing almost nothing here.\n\n**The refrain of explanation:** \"as if / the body were a instrument tuned to know its silence\" appears twice (lines 4, 26), each time deflating what should be an arresting image. **Direction:** Delete both instances. Let the door handle and keychain moment stand alone \u2014 the reader can infer tuning without being told it's musical.\n\n**The explanatory frame (\"no one says anything about saying goodbye\"):** This is a dead metaphor dressed in self-awareness. It tells us grief is happening through negation, which is still negation. **Direction:** Cut entirely. The coat on the chair and the table compacted against nothing are already doing that work.\n\n**\"Snow drives itself ahead in the window\" (line 1):** This is a clich\u00e9 of snow \u2014 impersonal, atmospheric, generic. It sets mood without committing to anything specific. **Direction:** Either make it concrete (\"drifts,\" \"light bending through grafoil\") or cut it; it doesn't earn its place until after line 20.\n\n**\"The cardinal has flown\" (lines 7 and 31):** Appearing twice dilutes both instances. If the bird matters, it should arrive once with enough detail to justify its weight. **Direction:** One instance \u2014 and make it visible.\n\n### Summary Direction\n\nCompress the",

      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe closing three lines \u2014 \"the light is low enough that everything grows a little darker / when you turn\" \u2014 are the most alive in this draft because they stay inside physical perception without explaining grief or naming it. The radiator ticking, the thumb making a crease while thinking about something else entirely (lines 27\u201328), and the coat on the chair (lines 20\u201321) also work because they arrive late enough to carry weight.\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Redundancy / structural bloat:** The poem says almost exactly what it's saying in its first half, then restates itself with \"while thinking about something else entirely\" as a deflationary clause (lines 13\u201316). Cut both instances or compress dramatically \u2014 the poem's engine is lines 20\u201328. Everything before line 20 should be rebuilt to arrive at that second half faster.\n\n**Expository filler:** \"A cactus leaning slightly left,\" \"the mail, the phone\" \u2014 these are catalog items that add nothing specific.

What kind of fold?
