      "draft": "In winter's grip, the barren trees stand,\nGuardian shadows on a twilight plain.\nDead leaves whisper of paths untried,\nTheir silent dance under moonlit sky.\n\nThrough the frozen river, time unfolds\u2014  \nEach stone beneath the ice holds stories untold.\nThe snow, soft blanket over world soiled,\nCovers in hush where life and death are one.\n\nSpring comes gentle with the thawing stream,\nBirch trees crackle into green new dreams.\nRoots stretch deep as ancient secrets lie\nBuried within a soil of winter\u2019s sigh.\n\nAs buds unfurl their first tentative leaves,\nThe light stirs, waking slumber from its sheen.\nLeaves rustle in the gentle breeze that speaks\nOf journeys far and close, of paths we chose or seek.\n\nSummer's heat blankets earth with warmth\u2014  \nA garden lush where colors all burst. \nBut shadows linger like forgotten guests,\nGuarding quiet corners and secrets unrest.\n\nAutumn\u2019s breath paints leaves in fiery hue,\nAs days grow short and skies turn clear, bright blue.\nHarvested fields yield to the chill that spurs\nMigrations southward, tales of life's true stars.\n\nIn each season\u2019s close, night descends anew\u2014  \nSleeping cradles dreams through starlit nights. \nSilent whispers float on evening air,\nGuiding us across landscapes we bear.\n\nThrough spring\u2019s rebirth and summer\u2019s blaze,\nTo autumn\u2019s harvest and winter\u2019s embrace.\nDeath, our constant silent companion,\nBeneath the moon where shadows play.",
      "critique": "What works:\n- The imagery of natural landscapes and seasons effectively represents the cycles of life, death, and rebirth.\n- The transitions between stanzas mirror the shifts in time and state, creating a cohesive flow.\n\nIssues:\n1. **Weak Line Breaks**: Some lines feel too long or could be more impactful if broken differently. For example, \"Dead leaves whisper of paths untried,\" could benefit from a break after \"untried\" to emphasize the idea.\n2. **Overuse of Metaphors and Personifications**: While rich in imagery, some metaphors are overused, such as describing time \"unfolding\" or the light \"waking slumber.\" This can make the poem feel overly ornate.\n3. **Sentimentality**: The tone leans towards a sentimental view of death and sleep, which might detract from the intended exploration of their silent companionship.\n\nDirections:\n- Consider breaking lines to create more impact, such as: \n  - \"Dead leaves whisper / of paths untried\"\n  - \"Each stone beneath the ice / holds stories untold\"\n\n- Reduce the number of metaphors and personifications. For instance, instead of saying \"time unfolds,\" try a simpler phrase like \"time passes.\"\n\n- Tone down the sentimentality by focusing more on the silent presence of death and sleep as companions rather than as comforting figures.\n\nWhen these adjustments are made, this poem has found its shape.",
