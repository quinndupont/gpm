  "final_poem": "# Loss, the Season\n\nThe orchard dropped its weight before the fall\u2014\neach fruit separating from the tree\nthe way a word leaves the mouth,\nmeaning already gone.\n\nI found it on the ground, still partly red,\nthe bruise already darkening.\nHold something that has fallen fully\nand understand: the grip was never strong enough.\n\nThere is a kind of absence that makes room\nfor everything else. The table set but for one chair.\nThe yard wide open to the evening light.\nLoss organizes the ordinary into presence\u2014\nthe dog's head on the pillow, the cup\nleft out as if for sharing,\nthe window you keep moving toward\nbecause the view keeps changing\nand you want to see what comes next.\n\nWhat comes next is not a replacement.\nIt is the afternoon arriving earlier\nat the kitchen window, or the cardinal\nthat lands on the frozen feeder\nas if to say: something else, yes\u2014\nbut also, this was never yours,\nthis thinning orchard, these empty rooms,\nthis body that holds weight\nonly while standing in it.\n\nYou will find your hands still open.\nThat is what loss does:\nit teaches you to hold\nwhatever arrives without guarantee,\nto let the cup be half-full\nor empty or the shape\nthat happens at the last moment\nto fit whatever's there.",
