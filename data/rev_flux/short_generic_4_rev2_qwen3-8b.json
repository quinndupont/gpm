      "critique": "**What\u2019s alive:**  \nThe poem thrives on visceral, specific imagery\u2014weight of a key, scent of dust, texture of paper\u2014that grounds memory in physicality. The tension between presence (the room\u2019s memory) and absence (the speaker\u2019s erasure) is sharp. Enjambment and fragmented lines mirror the disjointedness of recollection.  \n\n**Issues:**  \n- **Abstraction:** \u201cSyntax of forgetting\u201d risks over-clarifying the ineffable; the metaphor feels intellectualized rather than sensory.  \n- **Weak line breaks:** The dash in \u201cThe scent of a dusty book\u2014ozone and static\u2014\u201d flattens the pause, diluting the fragmentation. A hard break after \u201cbook\u201d would heighten the sense of lingering.",
