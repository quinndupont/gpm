      "draft": "In the digital garden, roots entwine,\nNot just in time but through shared design.\nEach node a thought, each thread a heart's code,\nWiring emotions to form an electric ode.\n\nBeneath the surface, where whispers meet,\nA forest of connections grows and feet\nStep lightly over paths laid by laughter,\nOr rest upon stools of quiet repast.\n\nThese are not ties woven in days or years,\nBut fibers spun from shared tears.\nIn storms, they offer shelter, in droughts, sustain,\nEach leaf a pulse, each root a refrain.\n\nSo let us tend this landscape with care,\nFor friendship's impact is far beyond compare.\nIt blossoms where the mind and soul unite,\nIn exchanges that build and set us free.",
      "critique": "What's alive:\n- The metaphor of friendship as a digital garden and network of connections is compelling.\n- The imagery of roots entwining, nodes, threads, and fibers effectively conveys the depth and complexity of friendship.\n\nIssues:\n1. **Weak Line Breaks**: Lines like \"Beneath the surface, where whispers meet,\" and \"A forest of connections grows and feet\" are awkwardly placed, disrupting the flow.\n2. **Overuse of Metaphor**: While metaphors are strong, there's a risk of overusing them which can make the poem feel cluttered. For instance, \"threads a heart\u2019s code\" and \"fibers spun from shared tears\" might be too literal or redundant.\n\nDirections:\n- Revise line breaks to enhance rhythm and meaning. Consider breaking lines where they create pauses for reflection.\n- Reduce some metaphors to avoid redundancy. For example, you could focus on one central metaphor (like the digital garden) and use imagery more sparingly throughout the poem.\n\nWhen done, this poem has found its shape.",
