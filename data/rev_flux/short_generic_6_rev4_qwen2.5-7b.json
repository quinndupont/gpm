      "draft": "In the heart of silicon dreams,\nWhere holograms embrace and beam,\nA world where distance means nothing more\u2014\nVR avatars share their stories, in perfect chore.\n\nNeurons link through digital threads,\nPulse patterns sync without a need for words.\nThe AI companions, wise and kind,\nEcho thoughts, reflect the mind\u2019s design.\n\nYet shadows loom on synthetic shores,\nWhere hearts connect less than they adore.\nFor though screens offer endless views,\nThey blur what truly matters in a hush of blues.\n\nIn this realm where time is bent to will,\nWill touch and warmth find their true fill?\nOr does our tech-bound quest for more\nDim the very essence we hold so dear?",
      "critique": "What's alive:\n- The imagery of a futuristic technological world where holograms and VR avatars interact.\n- The contrast between the promise of technology to connect and the potential for it to disconnect.\n\nIssues:\n1. **Weak Line Breaks**: Lines like \"Where holograms embrace and beam\" and \"Pulse patterns sync without a need for words\" could benefit from more strategic breaks to enhance rhythm and emphasis.\n2. **Sentimentality**: The last stanza leans into sentimentality, which can feel heavy-handed if not balanced with the earlier sections.\n3. **Overuse of Abstract Terms**: Phrases like \"silicon dreams,\" \"digital threads,\" and \"synthetic shores\" are abstract but could be more vivid.\n\nDirections:\n- Strengthen line breaks to improve rhythm and emphasis. For example, consider breaking \"Where holograms embrace and beam\" into two lines: \"Where holograms / embrace and beam.\"\n- Balance the sentiment in the final stanza by revisiting earlier imagery or adding a concrete detail that reinforces the theme.\n- Replace abstract terms with more vivid ones. For instance, instead of \"silicon dreams,\" consider something like \"neon utopias.\"\n\nWhen these adjustments are made, this poem has found its shape.",
