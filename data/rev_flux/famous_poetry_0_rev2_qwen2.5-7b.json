      "draft": "Amidst the whispering leaves, I stand,\nA breath held in the quiet air.\nThe scent of pine clings to my coat\u2014\nAn ancient story whispered here.\n\nI hear no forks; instead, two paths\nLie hidden beneath a cloak of green.\nA rustling comes from each direction:\nOne leads deep into shadowed shade;\nThe other calls with brighter light,\nYet both are silent in the breeze.\n\nMy fingers trace the bark of trees,\nCool and smooth against my touch.\nWhat drives me here, at this crossroads?\nIs it not just a need to grow?\n\nI breathe in deeply: earthy, damp\u2014\nA reminder that I am not alone.\nYet, each choice sets me apart,\nEach path a silent echo of the self.\n\nIn my chest, the heart drums softly,\nA rhythm born from endless nights.\nTo go one way or another\u2014what if?\nThe journey\u2019s length is all there is.\n\nI close my eyes and let the past\nBlend with the present in this moment.\nWhat do I know but what I feel,\nAnd how does feeling shape tomorrow?\n\nThe path ahead remains unseen,\nYet something stirs beneath the bark.\nA promise, perhaps, or a lie?\nIn silence, I embrace uncertainty.",
      "critique": "What's alive:\n- The tactile, olfactory, and auditory details create a vivid forest setting.\n- The internal monologue captures the traveler\u2019s thoughts and emotions effectively.\n- The use of silence and uncertainty adds depth to the poem.\n\nIssues (type, location, direction):\n1. **Weak Line Breaks**: Lines 6-7 and 8-9 could be more impactful with revised line breaks. Consider breaking \"One leads deep into shadowed shade\" onto a new line to emphasize the path's depth.\n2. **Overly Abstract Statements**: Lines 30-31, \u201cTo go one way or another\u2014what if? The journey\u2019s length is all there is.\u201d are somewhat abstract and could be more specific to the traveler\u2019s experience.\n3. **Sentimentality**: Line 34, \"In silence, I embrace uncertainty,\" leans towards a sentimental tone that might detract from the internal journey's complexity.\n\nDirections:\n1. Revise line breaks in lines 6-9: \n   - Break \u201cOne leads deep into shadowed shade\u201d onto a new line to emphasize the path\u2019s depth.\n2. Replace abstract statements with more specific details, such as:\n   - \"To choose one way or another\u2014what if my future lies hidden?\"\n3. Tone down sentimentality by focusing on concrete actions or thoughts, like:\n   - \u201cIn silence, I listen for the whispers of the forest.\u201d\n\nWhen these revisions are made, this poem has found its shape.",
