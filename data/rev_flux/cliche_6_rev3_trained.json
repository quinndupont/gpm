It's sensory, specific, and does what the poem needs \u2014 it registers attention without naming attention.\n\nThe shift from *find* (line 4) to the more passive, almost geological language of receptor binding in lines 6\u20138 works structurally: the poem moves from a sudden, urgent verb toward something colder and more inevitable. That's good craft.\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Abstraction bloat \u2014 lines 9\u201313.**\n*\"A protein binding to its ligand\"* is doing real scientific work, but the next three lines (\"the way a key reads only one lock,\" \"my thumb left a damp print on the glass,\" \"a small opacity\") are all trying to explain it in too many ways at once. The poem loses momentum in this passage because it's *telling* its own metaphor rather than trusting the receptor language to carry weight alone. **Direction:** Cut or compress lines 9\u201313. Let the protein binding stand as a concrete, unexplained image \u2014 or replace them with one or two more physical gestures that don't also narrate what they mean.\n\n**Clich\u00e9 residue \u2014 \"realized my collarbone / was a pressure point.\"**\nThis is almost a clich\u00e9 of self-knowledge. The poem has done better work earlier (the thymus, the cells tuning). This feels like it wants to name the feeling rather than enact it. **Direction:** Find an image as precise as \"a damp print on glass\" for what happens in the collarbone. What does pressure there actually feel like \u2014 sharp, diffuse, cold? Name that instead.\n\n**Line 2 is weak.**\n\"Every muscle suspending / its minor functions\" is vague and syntactically convoluted without earning the compression it tries for. **Direction:** Rewrite line 2 to either sharpen the verb or simplify the syntax so it lands harder at the start of this sequence.\n\n**The poem's arc risks being too neat.**\nIt begins with a private, almost clinical observation (receptors), moves through several explanatory gestures, and closes on quiet stillness \u2014 which reads as a satisfying resolution the poem hasn't earned through its whole body. The middle still relies on explanation rather than lived experience. **Direction:** Test: read the draft aloud without your own knowledge of where it's going.

      "critique": "## Revision Workshop Response\n\n---\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe closing image \u2014 \"like anything that has no choice\" \u2014 is the poem's real engine. It earns its weight because it stays quiet and trusts the reader to feel compulsion without being told \"I was compelled.\" The shift from *yearning\u2014too warm* (line 8) to something closer to habit or instinct is precise: \"silently, / like anything that has no choice\" \u2014 too warm, too named. That's good craft.\n\nThe line \"My thumb left a damp print on the glass / between us\" is also alive. It's sensory, specific, and does what the poem needs \u2014 it registers attention without naming attention.\n\nThe shift from *find* (line 4) to the more passive, almost geological language of receptor binding in lines 6\u20138 works structurally: the poem moves from a sudden, urgent verb toward something colder and more inevitable. That's good craft.\n\n---\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Abstraction bloat \u2014 lines 9\u201313.**\n*\"A protein binding to its ligand.\"* is doing real scientific work, but the next three lines (\"the way a key reads only one lock,\" \"my thumb left a damp print on the glass,\" \"a small opacity\") are all trying to explain it in too many ways at once. The poem loses momentum in this passage because it's *telling* its own metaphor rather than trusting the receptor language to carry weight alone.\n\n**Direction:** Cut or compress lines 9\u201313 entirely. Let the protein binding stand as a concrete, unexplained image \u2014 or replace them with one or two more physical gestures that don't also narrate what they mean. The poem is stronger at \"My thumb left a damp print on the glass\" than it is in explaining what that means.\n\n**Clich\u00e9 residue \u2014 \"realized my collarbone / was a pressure point.\"**\nThis is almost a clich\u00e9 of self-knowledge. The poem has done better work earlier (the thymus, the cells tuning). This feels like it wants to name the feeling rather than enact it.\n\n**Direction:** Find an image as precise as \"a damp print on glass\" for what happens in the collarbone. What does pressure there actually feel like \u2014 sharp, diffuse, cold? Name that instead of naming the anatomical function.\n\n**Line 2 is weak.**\n\"Every muscle suspending / its minor functions\" is vague and syntactically convoluted without earning the compression it tries for.\n\n**Direction:** Rewrite line 2 to either sharpen the verb or simplify the syntax so it lands harder at the start of this sequence \u2014 right now it's a prelude that blunts what follows.\n\n**The poem's arc risks being too neat.**\nIt begins with a private, almost clinical observation (receptors), moves through several explanatory gestures, and closes",
