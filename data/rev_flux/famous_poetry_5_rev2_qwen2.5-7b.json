      "draft": "Through gnarled branches, fingers of sunlight  \ndrape shadows like old garments. Bark, rough as leather,  \ncrinkles under my claws; a reminder of age.  \nA whispering wind stirs secrets in leaves\u2014  \nsoft whispers that dance and float away.\n\nNecks stretched long to catch the sun's first warmth,  \nwings half-spread for balance\u2014a moment poised.  \nDistant calls punctuate silence:  \ncroaks from shadowed corners, hoots that bounce,  \nechoes of a wild symphony.\n\nBelow, the earth cradles roots deep and strong\u2014  \na network woven through time's slow thread.  \nHere, every grain, every stone, holds stories\u2014  \nthe silent, steadfast guardians of nature's cycle.  \n\nIn this space, I am not lost; merely navigating  \npaths worn by countless wings before mine.  \nEach beat of my heart syncs with the rhythm  \nof life that thrums through branches and earth alike.",
      "critique": "What's Alive:\n- The tactile and auditory elements of the natural world are vividly portrayed, such as \"bark, rough as leather\" and \"whispering wind stirs secrets in leaves.\"\n- The bird\u2019s perspective is well established through lines like \"Through gnarled branches, fingers of sunlight / drape shadows like old garments.\"\n\nWhat Isn't Working:\n1. **Weak Line Breaks**: Some lines feel too long or lack effective breaks that could enhance the imagery and rhythm.\n2. **Clich\u00e9 Phrases**: The phrase \"croaks from shadowed corners\" is a clich\u00e9, which detracts from the poem's originality.\n\nDirections:\n- Revise line breaks to create more dynamic phrasing. For example, consider breaking \"Through gnarled branches, fingers of sunlight / drape shadows like old garments.\" into two shorter lines: \"Through gnarled branches, fingers of sunlight / drape shadows, like old garments.\"\n- Replace clich\u00e9d phrases with fresh language. Change \"croaks from shadowed corners\" to something more original, such as \"murmurs from hidden hollows.\"\n\nWhen the poem is truly complete:\nThis poem has found its shape.",
