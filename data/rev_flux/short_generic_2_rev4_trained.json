It rubs slow.\nWhat it discovers: nothing worth\n\nremoving. So it writes again,\nsmaller, softer, part of the green\neffacement\u2014I am becoming\nwall, become the weather's thin\n\nskin. Drip.

And still\nthe knock reverberates inside me\u2014\na year's worth of silence\n\nbetween each tap\u2014and I am grateful\nfor the way forgetting\ncan be so complete\nit leaves a hollow\n\nthat even spring\nhas no use for, and that is\nexactly what I always\nhad to offer.",
      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe central conceit\u2014writing on a tin can as a body, not a vessel\u2014is genuinely compelling. The line \"I do not bloom. I am the sound left after / bloom\" earns its place: it inverts the expected arc without explaining itself. The dog lifting its nose and the cardinal knocking are two of the poem's sharpest moments\u2014small, physical events that carry enormous meaning through implication.\n\nThe rust as a thumb letting breath in is precise and tactile. \"Moss presses its fingers clean across\" has an unexpected verb choice (\"presses,\" \"fingers\") that gives moss hands without sentimentalizing it. The line \"I do not know what year it is\" lands hard because the poem has earned the right to say this plainly.\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Rhyme clutter (throughout).** The rhyme scheme is driving the poem rather than serving it. Lines are being contorted to land rhymes, and words chosen for sound that undermine meaning or imagery. \"A cursive no one meant to read\" \u2014 \"read\" exists only as a rhyme for \"held.\" Direction: strip all end-rhyme from the draft. Rewrite with only interior consonance and repetition doing work. Let \"I do not bloom\" stand on its own weight; it doesn't need \"bloom\" again as rhyme in line 47.\n\n**Abstraction swamping imagery (lines 28\u201336).** \"And still / the knock reverberates inside me\u2014 / a year's worth of silence / between each tap\u2014and I am grateful.\" This reads like prose dressed in lines. Silence is named twice, time is explained, gratitude appears out of nowhere with no earned texture. Direction: replace this passage entirely with one or two physical images that embody what the knock means without narrating it.\n\n**Clich\u00e9 reemergence (lines 37\u201340).** \"The soil moves through my walls / the way a lung breathes / taste of earth, taste of what I held.\" The simile collapses into vagueness. \"Taste\" appears twice in four lines. Direction: choose one sensory verb that doesn't mean anything until placed inside a specific scene.\n\n**Sentimentality (closing).** \"And that is / exactly what I always / had to offer.\" This tells the reader what the poem has already shown, and it does so flatly. The ending earns no final gesture because nothing has been at stake in the last six lines. Direction: cut entirely or replace with a single image that closes without summarizing.\n\n**Line breaks (throughout).** Many lines break on function words (\"of,\" \"that,\" \"it\") rather than on tension. \"I read backwards now, / the ink erased\" \u2014 \"now\" as its own line does nothing.

      "critique": "## Revision Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe dog lifting its nose (line 23) and the cardinal knocking (lines 24\u201325, 28\u201329, 37\u201338) \u2014 these are two of the poem's sharpest moments: small, physical events that carry enormous meaning through implication. The tin can doesn't \"bloom\" or \"awake.\" It doesn't change in any stated way; what changes is everything around it.\n\n\"I do not know what year it is\" lands hard because the poem has earned the right to say this plainly.\n\n\"The sound my lungs would make / if I had lungs to spare.\"\n\nThis line works because \"lungs\" does double duty \u2014 breath and weight. It earns its place.\n\n---\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Rhyme clutter (throughout).** The rhyme scheme is driving the poem rather than serving it. Lines are being contorted to land rhymes, and words chosen for sound that undermine meaning or imagery. \"A tea-ring, a writing I didn't mean to keep\" \u2014 \"keep\" exists only as a rhyme for \"seem.\" Direction: strip all end-rhyme from the draft. Rewrite with only interior consonance and repetition doing work. Let \"I do not bloom\" stand on its own weight; it doesn't need \"bloom\" again as rhyme in line 47.\n\n**Abstraction swamping imagery (lines 28\u201336).** \"And still / the knock reverberates inside me\u2014 / a year's worth of silence / between each tap\u2014and I am grateful.\" This reads like prose dressed in lines. Silence is named twice, time is explained, gratitude appears out of nowhere with no earned texture. Direction: replace this passage entirely with one or two physical images that embody what the knock means without narrating it.\n\n**Clich\u00e9 reemergence (lines 37\u201340).** \"The soil moves through my walls / the way a lung breathes / taste of earth, taste of what I held.\" The simile collapses into vagueness. \"Taste\" appears twice in four lines. Direction: choose one sensory verb that doesn't mean anything until placed inside a specific scene.\n\n**Sentimentality (closing).** \"And that is / exactly what I always / had to offer.\" This tells the reader what the poem has already shown, and it does so flatly. The ending earns no final gesture because nothing has been at stake in the last six lines. Direction: cut entirely or replace with a single image that closes without summarizing.\n\n**Line breaks (throughout).** Many lines break on function words (\"of,\" \"to,\" \"in\") \u2014 this creates prose-like flatness where compression is needed. Direction: break lines only to create tension between syntax and breath, not just for rhyme.",
