  "final_poem": "America sings in whispers and shouts,\nA chorus of difference, yet one note clouts\nFrom fields to cities, factories to towns,\nEach voice echoes, beating like a drum's rounds\n\nThe farmer rises with dawn's pale light,\nHis song's a murmur, a gentle plow's delight\nAs sunbeams warm the earth beneath his feet,\nHe chants of crops and harvests yet to meet\n\nIn mills and mines, their voices blend and rise,\nA roar that rumbles like an underground surprise\nTheir songs are laments for labors lost and gained,\nEchoes of dreams and struggles in their refrain\n\nThe singer at a street corner holds her stage,\nHer voice rings out like city pavement's cage\nShe echoes with hearts beating wild and free,\nFor freedom, justice, equality, she sings to be\n\nEach worker their own song, an American hue,\nA tapestry rich woven from threads anew.",
