  "final_poem": "In twisted woods where sunlight strays,\nA traveler stands, with heart aflame,\nTwo roads converge, a choice to make,\nThe less-traveled path, her claim to fame.\n\nShe weighs each road, with careful eye,\nAnd chooses one, that winds and sighs,\nThrough trees that whisper secrets old,\nWhere few have tread, and fewer told.\n\nWith steady step, she takes the lead,\nAnd leaves behind the crowded thread,\nThat once did beckon, with false ease,\nNow abandoned, like a summer's breeze.\n\nThe trees grow taller, darker, still,\nAs if in witness to her will,\nTheir branches stretch, a somber hand,\nGuiding her forward, through this mystic land.",
