      "draft": "Clinging to rafters, feathers barely whisper,\nEach tread a creak under shadowed wings.\nVoices of past storms echo in my bones\u2014\nThe rhythm of wave crashes against distant shores,\nA haunting lullaby from time's own heart.\n\nI am the keeper of stories whispered low,\nOf tales etched into old timbers\u2019 grain,\nWhere secrets sleep and forgotten dreams linger.\nIn hollows where once laughter danced, now silent,\nMy presence a reminder that memories hold\nA power beyond the reach of daylight\u2019s grip.\n\nThrough windows fogged with age-old wistfulness,\nI see reflections of what was, now fleeting\u2014\nThe touch of hands on weathered pages turned,\nOf hands clasped in moments before they slipped away.\nIn every rattle of old doors creaking free,\nA whisper of life that time cannot erase.",
      "critique": "What's alive:\n- The tactile and auditory imagery, particularly in lines like \"Voices of past storms echo in my bones\" and \"In every rattle of old doors creaking free.\"\n- The sense of the raven as a keeper of stories and memories.\n\nIssues (type, location, direction):\n- **Weak line break**: Lines 3 and 4 are too closely connected; they should be separated to emphasize the contrast between the past storms' voices and the present moment.\n- **Abstraction**: Line 7 is somewhat abstract (\"Of tales etched into old timbers\u2019 grain\"), which might benefit from a more concrete image or metaphor.\n- **Weak line break**: Lines 10 and 11 are too closely connected, making it harder to parse the idea of memories holding power.\n\nDirections:\n- Break lines 3 and 4 apart: \"Voices of past storms echo in my bones\u2014\\nThe rhythm of wave crashes against distant shores.\"\n- Replace or refine line 7 with a more concrete image: \"Of tales etched into old timbers\u2019 grain,\\nWhere secrets sleep and forgotten dreams linger.\"\n- Separate lines 10 and 11 for clarity: \"In hollows where once laughter danced, now silent\u2014\\nMy presence a reminder that memories hold\"\n\nWhen these adjustments are made, this poem has found its shape.",
