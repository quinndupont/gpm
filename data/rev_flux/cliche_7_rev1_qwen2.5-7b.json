      "draft": "Whispers of wind carve through silent nights,\nGentle fingers tracing paths unseen.\nIn sand left by receding tides, \nFriends inscribe stories in lines so thin.\n\nThrough storms that rage and skies that clear,\nEach drop a moment, each beam an affair.\nLike rivers finding their way to seas,\nOur bonds shift subtly with the breeze.\n\nErosion shapes, yet leaves untouched the core\u2014\nA landscape of memories evermore.\nIn frost's soft touch or sun's fierce kiss,\nWe find ourselves in these shared shifts.\n\nAs twilight veils the day, we gather near,\nNot as static beings, but fluid scenes;\nEach friend a weather-beaten stone,\nBearing marks of time\u2019s slow moan.",
      "critique": "What's Alive:\n- The imagery of erosion and weather patterns effectively conveys the dynamic nature of friendship.\n- The metaphor of friends as \"weather-beaten stones\" adds depth to the poem, suggesting resilience and change.\n\nIssues:\n1. **Weak Line Breaks**: Lines 3 and 4 could benefit from a stronger line break after \"lines so thin,\" which would emphasize the delicate nature of shared stories.\n2. **Overuse of Metaphors**: While the erosion metaphor is powerful, it's overused in lines like \"Erosion shapes, yet leaves untouched the core\u2014\" This repetition can make the poem feel less fresh and dynamic.\n3. **Sentimentality**: The line \"Not as static beings, but fluid scenes\" leans towards a more abstract sentiment that might be too direct for the subtle tone of the rest of the poem.\n\nDirections:\n- Strengthen the line break after \"lines so thin\" to enhance the imagery: \"In sand left by receding tides, / Friends inscribe stories in lines so thin.\"\n- Consider replacing some metaphors with more specific imagery. For example, instead of \"Erosion shapes, yet leaves untouched the core\u2014,\" try something like: \"Like rivers finding their way to seas, / Our bonds shift subtly with the breeze, / Yet hold the essence of our shared dreams.\"\n- Refine the last line to maintain a more subtle tone: \"Each friend a weather-beaten stone, / Bearing marks of time\u2019s slow moan.\"\n\nWhen these adjustments are made, this poem has found its shape.",
