      "draft": "She's dancing with someone she will later\nforget. The floor is dark except for\nthe two of them and the slow\nturns are practice for something\n\nI don't mind. I brought a book.\nThe kind that closes itself after\na while, so I hold it open,\none hand pressed against its spine,\n\nmy other resting on the cushion\nwhere she would fit if fitting\nwere not the word for what happens\nwhen you wait and nothing\n\nchanges except the music\ngoes quieter or louder in my head.\nI know her face by now. I could\ndraw it in pencil, stay inside\n\nthe lines even when the outline\nbecomes a problem \u2014 how to render\nthe part that was never\nilluminated.\n\nA man at the bar turns off his phone.\nThe lede dissolves. Someone else's\nlife takes over the screen \u2014 a couple\nwalking hand and fist,\n\nwhich is not as good as it sounds,\njust the way two people can agree\nnot to open their hands, keep\nthe small contract of\n\nbeing together on a dark street\nwhere no one needs to see what you're carrying.\nI watch her smile. I mean the version\nof it stored inside me \u2014 the one\n\nthat doesn't require validation,\ndoesn't ask the face: are you still\nhere, still laughing at the thing\nyou said three tables over,\n\nstill feeling whatever it was?\nThe silence between us is a glass\nI keep refilling with water I don't\nhave. The cup is ours.\n\nSomewhere in another building a door\ncloses at two a.m. and that sound\nbecomes our border \u2014 what we can hear,\nwhat lies\n\ninside the pitch black of being\nalmost right, which is\nnot the opposite of being\nentirely wrong but more like\n\na temperature you feel after\ntouching something else.\nI will not say I was patient.\nPatience has its own\n\ndemands. But I did stay.\nThe barstools held me like a kind of seat.\nShe came back laughing at nothing,\nwhich is the greatest\n\ngift either of us gave \u2014\nthe way you can walk into a room\nand not be needed, and then be\nexactly the person who was\n\nsupposed to be there. The screen flickers.\nI think she sees it too.

      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe central conceit \u2014 a man watching his own relationship play out on someone else's screen, while he remains in the dark bar \u2014 is genuinely compelling. The poem earns its title by building toward that revelation slowly and with enough sensory detail to anchor it: \"A man at the bar turns off his phone. / The lede dissolves.\" That line break does real work; it isolates the speaker from the scene, just as he's about to be isolated.\n\nThe closing image \u2014 \"you spend years / afterward finding their name / on a list of things / you cannot explain\" \u2014 has quiet force. It resists sentimentality by staying concrete: a name on a list. That's something no one would write in a greeting card, and that specificity is where the poem earns its weight.\n\nThe line \"I know her face by now. I could / draw it in pencil, stay inside / the lines even when the outline / becomes a problem\" has real texture \u2014 the paradox of intimacy as constraint, rendered through physical gesture rather than declaration.\n\n---\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Clich\u00e9 and near-clich\u00e9 (pervasive):**\n- \"Falling in love was destiny\"\n- \"Happily ever after\" (even quoted)\n- \"Snow falling gently on a porch\" (implied, but the poem's own banal substitute)\n- \"Sunsets, beaches, or any landscape that stands in for romance\" \u2014 avoided, but the poem leans into similar substitutes: \"a dark street,\" \"a quiet bar.\" These are still generic settings. The real location is the liminal space between intimacy and estrangement; the setting should embody *that* rather than a generic urban night.\n- \"A ring appearing out of nowhere (or anywhere)\" \u2014 avoided, but the poem's own version (\"she comes back laughing at nothing\") tells us she returned without explanation, which risks being just as clich\u00e9.\n\n**Abstraction and sentimentality (lines 25\u201336):**\n\"Which is probably nothing \u2014 just / static of a night / where someone forgot their coat.\" This reads like the poem reaching for profundity. \"Static,\" \"forgetting,\" \"small act of being present enough\" \u2014 these are vague in service of feeling. The line before (\"She came back laughing at nothing, which is the greatest gift either of us gave\") already did the work with more honesty: she returned without explanation. The poem doesn't need to editorialize about what it means.\n\n**Redundancy / structural bloat (lines 15\u201324):**\nThe middle section \u2014 \"I know her face by now,\" \"the silence between us is a glass I keep refilling with water I don't have\" \u2014 restates the same feeling three different ways without advancing the poem. The glass metaphor (\"keep refilling / the cup is ours\") arrives",
