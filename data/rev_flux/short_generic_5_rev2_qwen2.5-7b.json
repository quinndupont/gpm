      "draft": "Screens glow, stark and bright,\nA cold embrace at night.\nFingers tap, touch nowhere\u2014\nSilent echoes of despair.\n\nWhere once were hands entwined,\nNow pixels dance inside.\nWarmth slips through glassy veils,\nLeaves ghostly fingers pale.\n\nWhispers float in binary,\nEchoes soft, digital.\nYet memory clings and yearns,\nFor the touch that fades from urns.\n\nInvisible threads break free\u2014\nNo longer hand to knee.\nThe net is vast, yet lonely,\nA void of lines too many.",
      "critique": "What's Alive:\n- The imagery of cold screens and warmth of human touch creates a stark contrast.\n- The use of enjambment effectively mirrors the fluidity between digital and physical presence.\n\nIssues:\n1. **Weak Line Breaks**: Lines like \"Where once were hands entwined, Now pixels dance inside.\" could be strengthened by adjusting the line breaks to better emphasize the contrast or create pauses that reflect the poem's theme.\n2. **Abstraction**: The phrase \"Invisible threads break free\u2014No longer hand to knee.\" is abstract and might benefit from more concrete imagery or a clearer connection to the theme of loss through technology.\n\nDirections:\n- Experiment with different line breaks in lines 3, 4, and 10 to enhance the contrast between physical and digital connections.\n- Replace \"Invisible threads break free\u2014No longer hand to knee.\" with something more specific. For example: \"Fingers once warm now cold\u2014No longer skin to hold.\"\n\nWhen these adjustments are made, this poem has found its shape.",
