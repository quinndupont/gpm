      "draft": "Dew clings to my fingertips,\na soft silk touch in chill air.\nThe ground whispers secrets\u2014\nlast night's storm drummed on earth\u2019s breast,\nechoes of winter now hushed, \nleaving moisture like forgotten dreams.\n\nA robin dips and rises,\nits wings slice the cool breeze,\na call between rain-kissed leaves.\nIts voice soars, a thin thread\nof song that threads through my heart,\ntangled with memories of storms past.\n\nLight sifts through mottled shadows\u2014\ndapples dancing on skin like old wounds,\nsunlight's fingers, seeking out pain.\nI close my eyes, let the light caress,\nand in its warmth, find fleeting solace.\n\nFootsteps echo down wet paths,\neach sound a small splash of water,\na reminder that still I walk alone,\nunder skies too vast for sorrow to fill. \n\nYet here and now, in this moment\u2019s breath,\nI hear spring's promise\u2014a pulse\nof life pulsing through the earth.\nAnd with it comes the gentle hum\nthat stirs what lies buried\u2014\nhope, like roots breaking free from soil.",
      "critique": "What's alive:\n- The tactile and auditory imagery effectively captures the essence of spring, particularly in lines like \"Dew clings to my fingertips\" and \"wings slice the cool breeze.\"\n- The emotional journey is well-explained through the character\u2019s reflections on past storms and present solace.\n- The line breaks create a natural flow that mirrors the movement described, such as \"A robin dips and rises,\" which mimics its flight.\n\nWhat isn't working:\n1. **Weak Line Breaks**: Lines like \"leaving moisture like forgotten dreams\" could benefit from a break to emphasize the metaphor more effectively: \n   - Current: \"leaving moisture like forgotten dreams.\"\n   - Suggested: \"leaving moisture / like forgotten dreams.\"\n\n2. **Clich\u00e9 Phrases**: The line \"sunlight's fingers, seeking out pain\" is close to a clich\u00e9 and could be more original:\n   - Current: \"sunlight's fingers, seeking out pain.\"\n   - Suggested: \"sunlight's caress, tracing old wounds.\"\n\n3. **Sentimentality**: The final stanza feels slightly sentimental with phrases like \"gentle hum that stirs what lies buried\u2014hope.\" Consider a more subtle approach:\n   - Current: \"And with it comes the gentle hum / that stirs what lies buried\u2014hope.\"\n   - Suggested: \"And with it, hope whispers, / stirring what lies buried.\"\n\n4. **Overuse of \"Spring\"**: The word \"spring\" is used multiple times in the final stanza, which can feel repetitive:\n   - Current: \"This pulse of life pulsing through the earth. And with it comes the gentle hum that stirs what lies buried\u2014hope, like roots breaking free from soil.\"\n   - Suggested: \"This pulse of life, stirring what lies buried. Hope, like roots breaking free from soil.\"\n\nWhen done:\nThis poem has found its shape.",
