      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### What's Alive\n\nThe central conceit \u2014 a poem about grief and quiet survival that never names itself as grief, instead building the feeling through domestic detail \u2014 is genuinely strong. The kitchen at 2:00 A.M., the black coffee poured twice, the brother's single-lit car across the street: these are precise, earned images. The closing image of faith \"not moving forward / but standing so completely\" has real weight because it arrives after a long accumulation of stillness.\n\nThe line \"a hinge that hasn't yet found its leaf\" is doing something interesting \u2014 literal door-joint meting against the feeling of potential opening without collapse. That's craft, not decoration.\n\nThe cough at 2:17 in another house earns its place because it arrives as pure sensory event first, then gets traced backward through the body.\n\n### What Isn't Working\n\n**Clich\u00e9 / Dead Language:** \"He sat on the edge of the bed / where folded clothes had piled overnight\" \u2014 this is furniture description that reads like a sitcom setup. The \"overnight\" tells us what we can see. Cut or replace with something only visible to the speaker at 2:00 A.M.\n\n**Sentimentality:** The final stanza slides toward summary. \"There's a word for not saying things.\" \u2014 this is the poem *telling* the reader what to feel rather than trusting its own images. Direction: delete the explanatory line entirely, or replace it with one image that does the work the explanation tries to do.\n\n**Redundancy:** The coffee gets poured twice (lines 7\u20138) and then again in a slightly different version later (\"he'd found his coffee black\" / \"his hands unclenched\"). One is enough. Direction: cut the second instance or make it specific enough that each pouring feels distinct.\n\n**Weak Line Breaks:** \"the way a dog might,\" \"and almost asks you / to answer.\" The comma after \"dog\" is doing nothing \u2014 it's a line break masquerading as punctuation. More seriously, \"to answer\" lands flat because the poem hasn't built enough pressure for that verb to do anything. Direction: find what the light *actually* does at the end of the final image. Right now it negotiates stillness and then gestures toward faith without landing.\n\n**Abstraction:** The poem is strongest when it's in a body (holding a coffee, pouring, coughing). When it drifts into abstraction (\"one small gesture,\" \"the quiet interval between / one breath and the next that doesn't judge it\"), it loses its specificity. Direction: every time you reach for explanation, replace with another thing the speaker *sees* or *hears.*\n\n**Direction Summary:** The revision path is narrowing toward trust in image over explanation",
