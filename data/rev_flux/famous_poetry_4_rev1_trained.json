      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe poem has genuine structural intelligence. The central conceit \u2014 the living person watching the dead one sleep, or rather not-sleep, through domestic routine after domestic routine \u2014 is well-chosen and earns its length. The strongest moments are where the speaker's awareness of being trapped breaks through into action (or lack thereof):\n\n> \"I have memorized your morning routine\u2014 / how the kitchen light stays off,\"\n\nThat line break does real work: it isolates a detail that only someone watching from outside would notice, and the enjambment gives the reader a flicker of what's happening before the next line confirms it.\n\n> \"a glass set down gently on the floor / so no one will hear the sound it makes.\"\n\nThe specificity here \u2014 the gesture motivated by silence itself \u2014 is precise and earns its place. The closing image also lands:\n\n> \"Your hand on the newspaper, / your coffee gone cold,\"\n\nThat final tableau does what the poem has been building toward without over-explaining.\n\nThe structural move of moving backward through a morning routine (coffee, light, newspaper) then pivoting to the domestic interior is well-paced. The dog passage from porch to screen door to click is one of the sharpest sequences in the draft \u2014 concrete, rhythmic, earned by what precedes it.\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Abstraction and explanation (sentimentality).** \"Grief\" appears as a word three times in the poem, and each time it's doing work that the images around it should be doing. The poem already *is* grief \u2014 the domestic routines are grief, the speaker watching is grief \u2014 so \"grief\" is redundant and slightly deflating. Direction: cut every instance of the word. Let the images carry the weight.\n\n**Repetition without variation (failure type: clich\u00e9 by habit).** \"I have memorized your morning routine,\" repeated in a close enough form to register as echo, but with no development between uses. The poem returns to the same domestic scene four or five times (coffee, light, newspaper, radiator, dog), and each return adds nothing new. Direction: make each domestic detail do different work. If the radiator is mentioned again, it should be doing something different from how it appeared in line 24.\n\n**\"The body learns its part before the soul / has settled on the chair's edge,\" (abstraction + personification).** This passage reaches for profundity and misses. \"Soul\" appears twice elsewhere too \u2014 \"the soul / has settled on the chair's edge\" and \"what the soul chooses not to name.\" The word is doing no real work; it's a placeholder for something the poem hasn't earned through its own language. Direction: cut all references to soul. Replace with physical detail that *shows* this separation.\n\n**\"A wait has purpose \u2014 / a",

Your shoes scuff the hallway carpet\neach evening, leaving marks no one will rub out.\n\nIn the window I watch your breathing: each inhale\na sail drawn taut across the table's edge,\neach exhale folding that cloth back into itself\u2014\nthat quiet negotiation between air and what\nyou choose not to name. The radiator ticks its teeth.\n\nI have been studying the way you sleep.\nNot the sleeping but the interval before:\nyour mouth slightly open, the chin dropping like a stone\nlet go from some height beyond the pillow,\nand at the last second something stops it there\u2014\nI have seen the brake. I have memorized its wear.\n\nYour coffee goes cold on the counter while\nyou are still arriving: your hand opens at the table,\nfingers loose as if something\nwere letting go of them, a glass set down gently\non the floor so no one will hear it.\n\nThe mailbox rattles with its ring. The yard drops.\nWhat I am looking for is not light or dark\nbut the precise moment the dog decides\nto come inside\u2014her head turning at some sound\nbehind the fence, her feet across the porch,\nthe screen door shoved open its full six inches,\nthe latch clicking shut.\n\nI could describe what happens between us as waiting.\nIt isn't. My hands do nothing. My body has forgotten\nwhat use would feel like.\n\nYour hand on the newspaper, your coffee gone cold,\n\nand the radiator ticks again. The dog is back inside.\nHer water bowl ticks its slow fill. You exhale\nover the headline you were reading\u2014something\nabout a town in Maine where the ice road\nhas reopened\u2014and I am somewhere else\nbeneath the window, watching the yard drop,\nthe light stay off, your heel slide across\nthe linoleum once more as if the floor\nmight still need holding.",
