Give you violet and copper\nmixed beneath the keel of something dead.\n\nThere is a depth where light does not go\u2014\nnot darkness either, but the thing beyond both,\nwhere pressure cracks bone into the shape of silence,\n\nand nothing comes back because nothing goes in.\nThat is the ocean's greatest honesty:\n\nit takes what has already left.",
