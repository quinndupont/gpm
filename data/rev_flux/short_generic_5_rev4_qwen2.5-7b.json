      "draft": "In the void where data streams,\nPackets drift, lost and dream.\nSilence on the digital line,\nEchoes of what once was fine.\n\nScreens glow cold and unfeeling\u2014\nWindows to worlds now sealed.\nSignals fade like whispered fears,\nGhostly in their failing ears.\n\nBluetooth hums, connects briefly,\nThen disconnects as quickly.\nIn this echo chamber's quiet,\nAlone we search for light.\n\nData shadows loom large,\nErasing traces of our rage.\nYet in these fleeting moments,\nVirtual voids fill our emptiness.",
      "critique": "### What Works:\n- The imagery of data packets and screens effectively conveys the theme of technological disconnection.\n- The structure with consistent tercets helps maintain a rhythmic flow.\n\n### Issues:\n1. **Rhyme Scheme:**\n   - **Issue Location:** Lines 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12\n   - **Failure Type:** Inconsistent rhyme scheme (ABA BCB CDC DED expected but not matched)\n   - **Direction:** Revise the rhymes to fit a consistent ABA BCB CDC DED pattern. For example:\n     - Line 3: \"Packets drift, lost and dream.\"\n     - Line 4: \"Silence on the digital line.\"\n     - Line 6: \"Screens glow cold and unfeeling\u2014\"\n     - Line 7: \"Signals fade like whispered fears.\"\n     - Line 9: \"Bluetooth hums, connects briefly,\"\n     - Line 10: \"Then disconnects as quickly.\"\n     - Line 12: \"In this echo chamber's quiet,\"\n\n2. **Meter:**\n   - **Issue Location:** Throughout the poem\n   - **Failure Type:** Dominant trochee foot (33% of feet)\n   - **Direction:** Adjust some lines to achieve a more iambic meter, which is expected for free verse. For example:\n     - Line 1: \"In the void where data streams\"\n       - Change \"void\" to \"space\" or \"stream.\"\n     - Line 2: \"Packets drift, lost and dream.\"\n       - Keep as is; it's already iambic.\n     - Line 3: \"Silence on the digital line,\"\n       - Change \"line\" to \"thread\" for better meter.\n\n### Workshop Response:\nThe poem effectively uses technology as a metaphor for disconnection. However, there are some issues with the rhyme scheme and meter that need addressing. To improve cohesion and flow:\n\n1. **Rhyme Scheme:** Revise the rhymes to fit a consistent ABA BCB CDC DED pattern.\n2. **Meter:** Adjust lines to achieve a more iambic meter.\n\nBy refining these elements, the poem will have a stronger structure and rhythm.\n\n### When Done:\nThis poem has found its shape.",
