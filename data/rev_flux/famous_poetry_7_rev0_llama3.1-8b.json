  "final_poem": "Two paths diverged in morning's hush\nThe one I took, a winding rush\nThrough familiar hills and verdant space\n Led me to where I now pace\n\nBut on that dawn, another road did lie\nA route less traveled, whispered by the sky\nIt beckoned with a siren's call\nTo leave the known and take it all\n\nIf I had taken that unseen way\nWould I have found a brighter day?\nPerhaps in distant fields I'd roam\nFree from the choices made back home\n\nOr maybe not. Maybe I would've strayed\nInto darker woods, lost in dismay\nThe road not taken, an unknown fate\nA mystery we can never participate",
