      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe final four lines are the poem's engine. \"I hear it on the way out\" \u2014 that line does real work: it narrows from sound to memory, and the verb *hears* is doing something unexpected for a speaker who has been described as walking past. The closing image of the line continuing to move without him there creates genuine estrangement between laborer and witness.\n\n\"He doesn't know me\" \u2014 this is precise and earns its place: it's not sentimentality because nothing follows it to soften. It lets the gap stand.\n\nThe specificity of \"capuchins of respirators\" \u2014 that's a real image, a small joke that does textural work (the roundness of the animals against the industrial equipment). The word *particular* in \"particular refusal\" risks tautology but actually lands because it's tied to the physical event.\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Clich\u00e9: \"I Had a King.\"**\nThe hymn title is doing heavy lifting \u2014 it carries social commentary, class feeling, private memory all at once \u2014 and yet it arrives as borrowed furniture. If this is a known song, the poem needs to *do* something with its content beyond invoking its name. What does \"I Had a King\" sound like? What does it feel like inside the meat? That's where the poem currently stops.\n\n**Direction:** Replace or cut the hymn reference entirely and build the religious register from sensory detail instead. Let the industrial body do what the song *wants* to do, if it wants anything.\n\n---\n\nThe revision direction is clear: strip the named song, rebuild the interior scene with sound and touch, and let the final line's estrangement deepen without explanation. The closing image is strong enough to support a shorter poem; right now the middle drags to catch up.\n\nThis poem has found its shape.",
