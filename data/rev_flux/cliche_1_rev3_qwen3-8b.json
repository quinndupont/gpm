      "critique": "**What\u2019s alive:**  \nThe metaphors of hands as a map and voice as a compass are consistent and vivid. The imagery of the mother\u2019s absence as a shadow that persists, and the child\u2019s voice becoming a map, anchor the poem in tangible, layered symbolism. The enjaringment and short lines mirror the unbroken continuity of the love, and the final lines tie the compass metaphor to the child\u2019s agency.",
