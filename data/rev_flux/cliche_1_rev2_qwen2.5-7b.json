      "draft": "In spring\u2019s gentle thaw,\nshe watches as roots unfurl, \nseeking sunlit freedom.\nHer hands no longer guide them;\nthey twist toward light on their own will.\n\nSummer rains coax lush growth\u2014\nwild and untamed under her gaze.\nLeaves rustle tales of distant skies,\nwhere she dreams he'll soon wander off to find his own ways. \n\nAutumn\u2019s crisp breath stirs change,\nas colors drift from boughs like stories whispered out loud.\nShe learns the art of silence, \na new language in the quiet spaces between.\n\nWinter's icy grip tightens round them all\u2014\na harsh reminder that bloom and fall come to every life.\nYet through it, she forges paths with him,\nteaching resilience, hand sketched on his map of memories. \n\nEach season a lesson, a gift unspoken,\nas she stands watch at the edge of her child\u2019s world.",
      "critique": "What's alive:\n- The metaphor of seasons to symbolize growth and the mother\u2019s evolving role.\n- The imagery of nature, particularly in describing the child\u2019s journey toward independence.\n- The emotional depth conveyed through the changing seasons.\n\nIssues:\n1. **Weak Line Breaks**: Some lines feel too long or lack necessary pauses that could enhance the flow and meaning.\n   - Example: \"Leaves rustle tales of distant skies\" could be split into two lines to emphasize the imagery and rhythm.\n2. **Overly Descriptive Language**: The poem is rich in detail but can sometimes lean towards over-description, which might detract from the emotional core.\n   - Example: \"She learns the art of silence, / a new language in the quiet spaces between\" could be simplified for more direct impact.\n\nDirections:\n- Revise line breaks to create a more rhythmic and flowing structure. For instance, break lines where natural pauses occur or where imagery needs emphasis.\n- Simplify some descriptive phrases to focus on core emotions and actions. For example, consider: \"She learns the art of silence / in quiet spaces between.\"\n\nWhen these adjustments are made, this poem has found its shape.",
