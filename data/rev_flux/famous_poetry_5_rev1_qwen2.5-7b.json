      "draft": "Eager claws peck softly at rough concrete,\na whisper of wings, a breath of stone.\nGrit crunches beneath talons,\nthe world compressed into silence.\n\nA faint screech, like sandpaper against bone\u2014\nnot harsh but subtle, an echo in the bone.\nFeathers brush dry asphalt, \nleaves rustle in passing breeze.\n\nScales clasp the grime of years,\na whispered conversation with shadows.\nEach step a negotiation with age,\ncracks widen under foot, secrets shared.",
      "critique": "What's alive:\n- The tactile and auditory imagery effectively brings the bird\u2019s presence to life, particularly in lines like \"Eager claws peck softly at rough concrete\" and \"A faint screech, like sandpaper against bone.\"\n- The use of irregular line breaks mirrors the unpredictable movements of the bird.\n\nIssues:\n1. **Weak Line Breaks**: Lines 3 and 4 are too closely connected, which can disrupt the flow and the sense of the bird's movement.\n2. **Sentimentality**: Lines 5 and 6 lean towards a more abstract or overly poetic tone that might detract from the concrete imagery.\n3. **Abstraction**: The line \"Each step a negotiation with age\" is somewhat abstract and could be made more vivid.\n\nDirections:\n1. **Revising Line Breaks**: Separate lines 3 and 4 to create a pause, enhancing the sense of the bird\u2019s movement: \n   - Original: \"Grit crunches beneath talons, the world compressed into silence.\"\n   - Revised: \"Grit crunches beneath talons.\n     The world compressed into silence.\"\n\n2. **Refining Sentimental Lines**: Simplify and ground lines 5 and 6 to maintain focus on tactile and auditory imagery:\n   - Original: \"A faint screech, like sandpaper against bone\u2014not harsh but subtle, an echo in the bone.\"\n   - Revised: \"A faint screech, like sandpaper against bone\u2014\n     Not harsh, just a whisper.\"\n\n3. **Clarifying Abstraction**: Replace the abstract line with something more concrete:\n   - Original: \"Each step a negotiation with age,\"\n   - Revised: \"Each step, a dance with shadows,\"\n\nWhen these revisions are made, this poem has found its shape.",
