  "final_poem": "In shadows, under weeping skies so grey,  \nA lone raven croaks a single 'nevermore', and stays away;   \nThrough hushed whispers of leaves that rustled with sorrow's echoes near his place beside the tombstone\u2019s cold embrace.      \nThe grieving man listens as rain tattoos forgotten memories,  \nHis heart bared for time to heal and mourners come in solace pace;    \nEach droplet a tear on heaven's face above his head sigh-hushed plea,   \n\"Remember me\", but the raven\u2019s word 'nevermore', unmoved by human fear.  \nIn this dance with grief and loss so heavy in its weight to bear \u2014\u2014 still he stands beneath regretful stars' gaze;    \nThe world moves on without him, yet love for his lost kin remains unforgotten share.      \nSo the raven croaks 'nevermore', a whisper against man\u2019s aching heart and tears \u2013  \nA testament to sorrow that through this pain he never truly cares as time weaves its golden thread into grief's tear-streaked air:    \nNever shall I love thee, O Death; for in silence my dearly loved one sleeps \u2014\u2014 yet even death cannot quench the raven\u2019s repeating 'nevermore.'",
