      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe central conceit \u2014 a janitor witnessing someone through the lens of daily, unremarkable observation \u2014 is genuinely strong and specific enough to sustain a poem. The water stain shaped like Ohio, the way she reads it \"as something directed at me,\" the shoeprints memorized down to asymmetry: these are precise, earned details that do real work. The final image of the state upside-down carries genuine weight because it arrives after building trust through accumulated attention.\n\nThe structural move from private observation (broom clicking stone) to a single moment where \"every sound in that corridor / became softer, carried\" is well-timed \u2014 the poem earns its quietness by accumulating noise first. That line about a lake going mute when a boat pulls away is one of the sharpest images here; it captures absence through physical analogy without stating \"I was gone.\"\n\nThe stanza beginning \"she stopped at the stairwell door\" has real momentum: the fish-in-water metaphor (pressing something flat against glass, forgetting to flip the light switch) lands because it's concrete and slightly absurd. The poem is doing its best work in these last twenty lines.\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Clich\u00e9 / sentimentality \u2014 \"I mention this to no one\" (lines 30\u201331).** This closing gesture is the weakest moment. It tells us the speaker is reticent and mysterious, but it's a stock move that asks for feeling without generating any. The poem has already shown us the reticence through the entire janitorial routine; \"I mention this to no one\" adds nothing new except an opportunity for vague admiration. **Direction:** Cut or replace with something as specific as what follows \u2014 the brick split, the state upside-down. The ending doesn't need to narrate its own importance.\n\n**Abstraction \u2014 \"a force / less urgent than gravity.\" (lines 7\u20138).** This is philosophy dressed in image-adjacent language. It explains rather than shows. **Direction:** Replace with a visual equivalent of that comparison, or cut the comparison entirely and let the coffee-mirroring image carry its own weight.\n\n**Clich\u00e9 \u2014 \"the exact duration it takes / a room to become someone's memory.\" (lines 26\u201327).** This is a paraphrase of what the poem has been doing for twenty lines. The specificity of stone clicking, light dimming, the boat pulling away \u2014 that's already *the* duration. **Direction:** Remove or compress this line so the final image can breathe.\n\n**Weak transition \u2014 \"This time it was upside down\" (line 37).** After the rich, physical detail of the brick and the state, this reversal arrives almost as a caption. It doesn't build from what came before; it summarizes. **Direction:** Consider ending on the image itself \u2014 let the reader discover",
