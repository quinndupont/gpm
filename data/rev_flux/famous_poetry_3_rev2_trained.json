      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe central conceit \u2014 that the poem lives inside a house and never enters the woods, only hears them pushing against an attic \u2014 is genuinely strong. It earns its abstraction (\"that soft / bag / of / wanting\") by grounding it in domestic detail: \"snow on tile,\" \"a coat with no pocket.\" The sensory layering works: heat, hands, clock, radiator, fog on glass.\n\nThe closing image (line 32) does what the brief asked \u2014 it arrives unannounced and carries weight without announcing itself. That's real craft. \"I've been the thing I'm listening for\" lands because of what precedes it.\n\nThe short lines are mostly serving the poem well, creating a claustrophobic rhythm that mirrors the experience of carrying weight inside a building.\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Clich\u00e9 proximity / near-clich\u00e9:**\n- \"fog spell my name backward then erase it\" \u2014 this is close to a stock dream-image. The poem earns its strangeness through domestic specificity; here it reaches for something that has been widely used in similar contexts.\n- \"believe in your own hands\" \u2014 too abstract and self-referential, bordering on tautology. What does the speaker actually *do* with these hands besides shake?\n- \"slow / indistinct, arriving after\" \u2014 the enjambment here is doing mechanical word-splitting rather than meaningful tension.\n\n**Abstraction bloat:**\nLines 15\u201320 are the weakest passage:\n> that soft / bag / of / wanting\n> to swallow down what I'm\n> carrying like a coat with no pocket,\n> like a coat that keeps filling.\nThe nested similes (coat with no pocket, coat keeping filling) pile without sharpening. \"Carrying\" appears twice in four lines and becomes generic. What *is* this weight? The poem is most alive when it names specific objects or textures \u2014 tile, snow, hands. Here it retreats into metaphorical vagueness.\n\n**Direction:**\nCut the nested similes. Choose one coat image (pocket or no pocket) and let that do the work alone. The \"bag of wanting\" needs to become a *thing* the body can touch.\n\n**Line 13 (\"under it all\") is vague and structural, not poetic.**\nWhat's under? The woods pushing against the attic \u2014 make that image more precise or cut the attic abstraction entirely so the domestic landscape doesn't get lost in allegory.\n\n**Direction:**\nIf the attic stays, render what it physically sounds like from inside a house (muffled, faint, persistent). If not, find another boundary condition for the woods.\n\nThe revision direction: sharpen the coat image and the final word-image; cut the excess metaphorical cushioning around the central conceit.

The short lines (5\u20139 syllables) are doing real work: creating claustrophobia that mirrors the experience of carrying something through domestic space.\n\n\"Snow on tile\" lands hard because it's concrete and specific. \"My hands forget what they're holding\" has genuine compression \u2014 the body forgetting mid-action is more precise than most opening lines.\n\nThe closing image (line 32) does what the brief asked: it arrives unannounced, carries weight without announcing itself, and earns its abstraction (\"the thing I'm listening for\").
