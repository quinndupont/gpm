      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe structural conceit is genuinely strong: a poem where time operates through the body rather than through clocks, and where each sentence carries one piece of information without naming \"time.\" The knee saying Tuesday before anything else appears on screen \u2014 that's precise, surprising, and earned by the context.\n\nThe radiator passage (starting \"The radiator clicks at intervals / that aren't random\") has real momentum. The idea of a thermostat learning posture overnight is genuinely strange and specific enough to hold attention. \"I find a match later, struck it in the sole of my foot\" \u2014 that's a moment where the body becomes absurd rather than decorative.\n\nThe closing line (\"Tuesday / inside my knee\") lands because the poem has been building toward an interior location for time all along. That accumulation matters.\n\nThe knife cutting banana and leaving \"peaks where I bit down, / valleys where I paused to think\" \u2014 that's a concrete metaphor doing real work: it tracks how memory gets inscribed in physical gesture without explaining itself.\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Overcrowding of imagery (syndrome, not failure).** The poem is stuffed with interesting metaphors and observations but doesn't let any one image breathe or develop fully before moving on. This is the biggest problem. Direction: **cut at least 40% by selecting only what arrives from the body-as-network angle described in the brief \u2014 the network of nerve impulses, synapses, postal service, code.** The knife/banana passage works because it stays focused. \"The skin on my forearm has crawled three times / this morning without itch\u2014each time, / a different language underneath the epidermis / attempting to translate itself into mine\" is four images stacked with no tension between them. Choose one: the sensation, the language, the translation attempt.\n\n**Sentimentality and self-referential deflation (lines 27\u201336).** \"I lick it because why not\u2014\" and the extended passage about permission-asking are the poem explaining itself to the reader rather than trusting its own strangeness. Direction: **remove or compress these moments entirely.** Trust that the image of a blister with its own clock is strange enough.\n\n**Clich\u00e9 residue (throughout).** Even where the poem resists \"time is a river,\" some language slips in: \"pressed into my sternum like a thumbprint\" (familiar metaphor for knowledge or revelation), \"a small black bag: heat, then silence, / then more heat\" (bag-as-heat is vague and generic), \"the ink pool / in the corner like a small black lake.\" Direction: **audit every noun that could be read as clock/calendar language.** If it reads like time on a wall or page, replace it with something interior \u2014 synapse, code, network.\n\n**Weak line breaks (lines 17\u201320",

The crescent moon I make\nwith one blade of butter knife leaves the fruit\nmarked like an EKG\u2014peaks where I bit down,\nvalleys where I paused to think about Tuesday,\nabout how my knee keeps remembering\na weather pattern it helped predict.\n\nThere's a language in the walls.\nI hear it through the pipes, a hiss and gurgle\nthat rearranges itself into words\nonly the copper pipe would use. It says things\nlike *arrivals* and *departures*, *processing*,\nand once I thought I heard *amortization*\nbut that might have been my jaw\n\nlocking open for no reason at nine-thirty.\n\nMy blood is a postal service. It delivers\nhormones I didn't address, it returns them\nuntouched because they bear no name.\nThe skin on my forearm has crawled three times\nthis morning without itch\u2014each time,\na different language underneath the epidermis\nattempting to translate itself into mine.\n\nI try writing Tuesday down in a notebook.\nThe page turns before I press the pen. I watch it turn\u2014\n\nsynapses realign, each one a tiny\ndetachment and reattachment of self,\nand what's lost doesn't stay lost but floats back\nas something almost readable, almost\n\na word I can use.\n\nSomewhere, a clock has intercepted my name\nand is sending it forward in jumps\u2014Tuesday,\nthen Wednesday already, then Thursday\nalready twice\u2014and I keep finding shoes\nlaced wrong because someone ahead of me\nknew where I was going and didn't want\n\nme there quite so soon.\n\nI peel another banana. The crescent moon\nis smaller this time. The knife has slightly\nshifted its groove in the fruit. Something\nin the kitchen has reorganized itself\naround a silence that is almost\n\nlike an invitation.\n\nThe radiator clicks again. This time\nit's followed by static\u2014low, then lower,\nthe frequency of something pressing through\na membrane it was never built to pierce\u2014\n\nand my knee says nothing.\nIt doesn't need to. It already knows\nwhat the air will do before the air does it,\nwhich is why I'm standing here in the warm water\nof an apartment that has been learning my shape\n\nfor some time I haven't yet stopped being.\n\nI set the glass on the counter and it rings\nlike a bone, like something handed down\na lineage of other kitchens\u2014other hands,\nother bananas, other peels. The ringing\nmoves into the wood. The wood sends it\nto the walls. The walls send it back\n\nand I hear Tuesday in the stack\nof all the Tuesdays that were never here at all,\n\nonly here now, inside my knee.",
