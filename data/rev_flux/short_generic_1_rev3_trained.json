      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### What's Alive\n\nThe central conceit \u2014 that memory becomes physical substance in water, something dissolved and carried away rather than recovered or lost \u2014 is genuinely original. The line \"the ocean keeps its arguments whole, / floating them apart at its own speed\" has real compression; it earns metaphor by grounding the abstract (memory) in a specific material action (currents separating particles). That's the poem's engine.\n\nThe detail of the glass dissolving through a palm is precise and strange enough to land. It works because it belongs to the ocean-as-body logic: what happens when liquid pressure encounters flesh? The sudden dissolution carries genuine strangeness.\n\nThe line \"each time returning to a thinner broth\" has real rhythmic compression \u2014 \"thinner broth\" does double duty (dilution, loss of substance) and moves with economy. That's how this poem thinks.\n\n### What Isn't Working\n\n**Abstraction bloat (lines 13\u201316):**\n\"The body forgets first the fingers.\nThen the words they held.\"\n\u2014 then \u2014\n\"it was not stone. Was not even thought\nin any state we'd call solid\"\n\u2014 followed by:\n\"the way you sit with your drink\nand suddenly the glass has gone\"\n\nThis is the poem explaining itself rather than trusting its own image. The fingers/words passage is pure abstraction dressed as revelation; it tells us forgetting follows a hierarchy without *showing* anything. \"Not stone. Not thought\" \u2014 this is the clich\u00e9 the brief warned against, rephrased. Direction: cut or replace with sensory material. What does water do to a finger? A hand?\n\n**Clich\u00e9 creep (line 17):**\n\"Was not even thought / in any state we'd call solid\"\n\u2014 and\n\"the way you sit with your drink\"\nThis reads like the poem reaching for its next image after the glass dissolved, and settling on something familiar. \"The way you sit\" is vague; \"your drink\" is specific but generic. Direction: if this needs to stay, find a concrete object that *also* dissolves or changes state.\n\n**Line 12 (weak):**\n\"What sank was not stone.\"\nThis line does nothing on its own \u2014 it's a setup for the next one, which then retreats into abstraction anyway. Direction: make \"sank\" do something visual and surprising in this line itself.\n\n**Sentimentality / vagueness (line 17 onward):**\nThe closing four lines shift from concrete image (glass dissolving) to summary (\"the ocean keeps its arguments\") without earning that elevation through the intervening material. The poem is strongest when it's *doing* \u2014 dissolving glasses, thinning broths \u2014 and weakest when it *tells us what the poem means*. Direction: end closer to the physical, with a final image that closes the argument rather than stating it.\n\n**Direction summary",

      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n---\n\n### What's Alive\n\nThe glass-in-the-palm dissolving is the poem's strongest moment. It's precise, strange, and grounded in physical reality \u2014 it earns its metaphor by staying rooted in sensation rather than floating away into abstraction.\n\n\"the slow work of salt on tissue\"\nhas real compression: \"tissue\" does double duty (membrane, flesh) with economy. That word is alive.\n\n\"What sank was not stone. Was not even thought\nin any state we'd call solid\u2014\"\n\nThe poem's central conceit \u2014 that memory dissolves like glass through a palm \u2014 lives here and nowhere else in the draft. The reader can see this happening.\n\n---\n\n### What Isn't Working\n\n**Abstraction and explanation (lines 13\u201320):**\n\"the body forgets first the fingers.\nThen the words they held.\"\n\u2014 \"it was not stone. Was not even thought\nin any state we'd call solid\u2014\"\n\u2014 \"the way you sit with your drink\nand suddenly the glass has gone\"\n\nThis is where the poem stops trusting its own image and starts *explaining* it. The fingers/words passage is pure abstraction dressed as revelation; it tells us forgetting follows a hierarchy without showing anything. \"Not stone. Not thought\" \u2014 this is the clich\u00e9 the brief warned against, rephrased.\n\n**Direction:** Cut or radically compress lines 13\u201316 entirely. Replace with one physical image of what happens to fingers underwater: pressure, dissolution, collapse. The poem doesn't need to name forgetting; it needs to *enact* it through sensory detail.\n\n---\n\n**\"The ocean keeps its arguments whole,\" (line 20):**\nThis is the poem's thesis statement. It tells us what the ending means instead of letting the glass-in-the-palm image do that work. The \"arguments\" metaphor also reads as a reach \u2014 the ocean doesn't literally hold debates, and the word \"whole\" undermines the dissolution the poem has been building.\n\n**Direction:** End closer to the physical. Let the final image carry the meaning. If an ending summary must stay, it should arrive from one step earlier, with less abstraction.\n\n---\n\n**Line 12 (weak):**\n\"What sank was not stone.\"\nThis line does nothing on its own \u2014 it's a setup for the next one, which then retreats into abstraction anyway. Direction: make \"sank\" do something visual and surprising in this line itself.\n\n---\n\n### Summary Direction\n\nThe glass-in-the-palm dissolving is the poem's engine. Cut all explanation after it; replace with physical images of what happens underwater to objects that *could* be human (fingers, hands). Trust the final image \u2014 let dissolution carry the meaning rather than stating \"the ocean keeps its arguments.\" The closing should arrive from the body of the poem, not from a summary.\n\nThis revision will be shorter. That's fine",

      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n---\n\n### What's Alive\n\nThe glass-in-the-palm dissolving is the poem's engine. It's precise, strange, and grounded in physical reality \u2014 it earns its metaphor by staying rooted in sensation rather than floating away into abstraction.\n\n\"the slow work of salt on tissue.\"\n\u2014 \"tissue\" does double duty (membrane, flesh) with economy. That word is alive.\n\n---\n\n### What Isn't Working\n\n**Redundancy / Overextension (lines 13\u201320):**\nThe poem's central conceit \u2014 that memory dissolves like glass through a palm \u2014 is restated and explained three times in these final seven lines. \"Not stone, not thought,\" \"the way you sit with your drink / and suddenly the glass has gone clean through,\" \"what sank was not stone\" (line 13, repeated as line 20). Each iteration retreats from image into summary. **Direction:** The dissolving of glass should be one physical moment \u2014 no more than three or four lines total. Let it happen, then move on. Trust the reader.\n\n**Abstraction and explanation (lines 15\u201316):**\n\"the body forgets first the fingers.\nThen the words they held.\"\n\u2014 \"it was not stone. Was not even thought\nin any state we'd call solid\u2014\"\nThis is pure abstraction dressed as revelation; it tells us forgetting follows a hierarchy without showing anything. **Direction:** Replace with one physical image of what happens to fingers underwater: pressure, dissolution, collapse.\n\n**\"the water's argument\" (line 10):**\nMetaphorically alive \u2014 the ocean pulling syntax apart. Keep it.\n\n**Line 20 (\"the ocean keeps its arguments whole\"):**\nThe poem's thesis statement. It tells us what the ending means instead of letting the glass-in-the-palm image do that work. \"Arguments\" is a reach \u2014 the ocean doesn't literally hold debates, and the word \"whole\" undermines the dissolution the poem has been building. **Direction:** End closer to the body. Let the final image carry the meaning. If an ending summary must stay, it should arrive from one step earlier, with less abstraction.\n\n**Line 12 (weak):**\n\"What sank was not stone.\"\nThis line does nothing on its own \u2014 it's a setup for the next one, which then retreats into abstraction anyway. **Direction:** Make \"sank\" do something visual and surprising in this line itself.\n\n---\n\n### Summary Direction\n\nThe revision should be shorter. Cut lines 13\u201320 entirely. The dissolving glass moment (lines 9\u201312) is already strong \u2014 it needs only tightening, not expansion. Trust the body's dissolution into water to carry metaphor; don't explain it three times or reach for \"arguments.\" End on a physical image.",
