      "draft": "He fixed the faucet in the bath before I woke.\nNot because he loved me, but because it leaked\nand a house that leaks is one that doesn't breathe,\nisn't worth the name of having been built.\n\nThe morning nails went missing from the shed\u2014\nhe drove them back. Each one pressed into its hole\nas if performing an inventory of the living.\nNothing was lost. Everything was just\nforgetting where it stood.\n\nI remember him naming things out loud\nat the kitchen table: that planet's Juno,\nthe pipe that sings when water finds a crack,\nthe crack itself, which split from expansion\nand needed only to be understood\nbefore he'd slide the sleeve in, mortar on his finger,\nbricks stacked like arguments you've worn down.\n\nHe never called it bravery. Said only\n*I had to*\u2014then went for more coffee,\n\nwhich was how it was.\nThe thing no one talks about:\nhow routine becomes your skin,\nhow you stop noticing that you're\nthe one holding up the wall.\n\n*\n\nTen years later I find a staple\ndriven through the heel of every box\nin the basement, each one labeled in his handwriting\u2014\n generator, freezer, wine, photos 2017.\nThe staples are there so nothing shifts\nwhen he opens it. He could have left space.\nHe could have let me feel the gap.\n\nInstead he made the gap irrelevant,\nthe way he always did: by not talking about it,\nby doing what had to be done\nuntil the house forgot his name for it.",
      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe staple detail in the final section is the strongest single stroke in this poem: \"I find a staple / driven through the heel of every box.\" This is precise, quiet, and carries enormous emotional weight without explaining itself. It enacts what the rest of the poem only describes \u2014 that care becomes routine so complete it's invisible.\n\nThe line \"how routine becomes your skin\" also lands hard because it's physical rather than abstract: you can feel the metaphor rubbing against the body. And \"he could have left space\" in the closing has genuine dramatic tension, letting the speaker name what was actually wanted without resolving into grief.\n\nThe shift from third-person narrative (\"the man who fixes every leak\") to second-person (\"I find a staple\") is structurally smart \u2014 it earns its arrival by building that gap between what's done and who notices.\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Sentimentality / earned vs. unearned emotion (lines 1\u20138).**\nThe opening quatrain tries to do too much setup before landing on the staple. \"A house that leaks is one that doesn't breathe\" is a line that *wants* to be profound but arrives as paraphrase \u2014 it explains rather than shows. The reader hasn't yet seen the leaking faucet, so the abstraction resists anchoring. **Direction:** Cut or radically compress this opening. Enter closer to the action. Let the staple open the poem; trust it.\n\n**Abstraction (lines 9\u201312).**\n\"Nothing was lost. Everything was just / forgetting where it stood.\" This is the poem's most abstract moment, and \"forgetting where it stood\" reaches for profundity without landing because it has no sensory anchor. **Direction:** Replace with a concrete image that carries the same weight as the staple \u2014 something visual, physical, specific to this house.\n\n**Clich\u00e9 residue (throughout).**\nEven within the domestic landscape, phrases like \"kitchen table,\" \"reading me stories till I fell asleep\" (even compressed), and \"tucking me in bed with a kiss\" linger faintly. The draft avoids many clich\u00e9s but defaults into furniture. **Direction:** Name one specific thing this dad did that *this* father only did \u2014 the poem is stronger when it commits to particularity.\n\n**Structural pacing (lines 13\u201324).**\nThe middle section risks losing momentum after the opening's punch. \"Naming things out loud\" at line 13 introduces a new image chain but doesn't quite find its own equivalent to the staple \u2014 it drifts into catalog. Lines 19\u201320 (\"the crack / which split from expansion\") are close to paraphrasing scientific fact rather than observation. **Direction:** The poem's second half needs one more concrete, unexplained image as devastating as the staples. Right now it builds toward the gap but doesn't fully inhabit",

He called it Juno,\nsat with his coffee, watching water run\nover a crack that made a sound like something\nlistening. He'd slide the sleeve in, mortar\ndried to dust across his forefinger, bricks\nstacked like arguments you've worn down\u2014\n\nnot because he loved me,\nbut because the house required it.\n\nTen years later I open a box marked *engineer's tools*\nand find the staple there again, thin steel\nbiting through leather so precisely\nit looks almost accidental.
