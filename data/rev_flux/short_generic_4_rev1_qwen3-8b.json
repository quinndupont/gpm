      "critique": "**What\u2019s alive:**  \nThe poem thrives on tactile, sensory-specific imagery: the scar as a \u201cmap of missed exits,\u201d the \u201cmetallic tang of a childhood cough,\u201d the \u201cmoth-wing crinkle,\u201d and the \u201cgrit of a forgotten fingerprint.\u201d These details anchor memory in the body\u2019s materiality, avoiding abstraction. The enjambment between lines like \u201cglass hums with the static of a summer storm\u201d and \u201cthere\u2019s a taste in my mouth\u201d mimics the fragmented, nonlinear flow of recollection.  \n\n**What isn\u2019t working:**  \n1. **Abstraction:** The line \u201cshe held me, her fingers tight as a noose, and I learned to swallow the sky\u201d relies on metaphor (\u201cswallow the sky\u201d) that feels disconnected from the poem\u2019s physical focus. The sky is too vast and abstract to align with the concrete imagery elsewhere.  \n2. **Weak line break:** The phrase \u201cthe air is thick with unsaid things\u2014\u201d ends a line abruptly,",
