      "draft": "In the silent hall where whispers hum,\nTwo fingers touch, soft as morning's first light.\nOne plucks the string of longing gently;\nThe other, still, listens to life's slight shift.\n\nThey strum their tales in quiet interplay\u2014\nA note here, a pause there; no set way.\nEach heart, an instrument that tunes its sound,\nAdjusting timbre 'til both find profound.\n\nFirst, it\u2019s tentative, like the night's first star;\nThen bold as dawn when skies transform to scar.\nThird, a chord resonates through chambers deep\u2014\nTwo souls in timelessness where echoes keep.\n\nFourth and fifth, adjustments made with care:\nOne too loud, the other needs its share.\nSixth, they blend; a harmony so rare,\nAs if by magic, two melodies there.\n\nSeventh string whispers of a shared refrain;\nEighth note dances on the breath's thin thread again.\nNinth bar brings pause where hearts align in space\u2014\nTenth note resolves the symphony it saves.\n\nTogether now their voices sing without words,\nIn perfect measure, as if fate had heard.",
      "critique": "What's Alive:\n- The metaphor of hearts as instruments tuning into each other\u2019s melodies is fresh and engaging.\n- The imagery of subtle adjustments and harmonies creates a vivid musical scene.\n\nIssues:\n1. **Weak Line Breaks**: Some lines feel too long, which can disrupt the rhythm intended to mimic heartbeats.\n2. **Overly Literal Metaphors**: While the metaphor is strong, some phrases are literal and could benefit from more poetic language.\n3. **Sentimentality**: The poem leans towards a sentimental tone at times.\n\nDirections:\n- Revise line breaks to enhance the rhythmic quality. For example, break \"First, it\u2019s tentative, like the night's first star\" into two lines: \"First, it\u2019s tentative\u2014like the night\u2019s first star.\"\n- Refine metaphors to avoid literal language. Change \"A note here, a pause there; no set way\" to something more evocative, such as \"A note whispers, a pause breathes; no fixed tune.\"\n- Tone down the sentimentality by focusing on the process of tuning rather than the outcome. For instance, change \"Together now their voices sing without words, in perfect measure, as if fate had heard.\" to \"Now, together they resonate, in perfect harmony, as if time itself listens.\"\n\nWhen these adjustments are made, this poem has found its shape.",
