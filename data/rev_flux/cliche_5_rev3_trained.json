      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### What's Alive\n\nThe poem has genuine structural intelligence. The three concrete moments \u2014 the coat, the sandwich, the sitting at the kitchen table until four in the morning \u2014 are earned through specific detail rather than sentimentality. Each one carries its weight without over-explanation.\n\n**The coat passage is the strongest single moment:** \"He pressed his mouth / into a line against the back of your mother's chair\" \u2014 that image does more emotional work than almost any other line here. The repetition in \"the kind with vines climbing through the cracks\" anchors domestic reality and stays concrete. \"Checking if the wall held\" is a devastating final gesture: it refuses to name itself as sacrifice.\n\n**The closing turn on Father's Day also lands:** \"then they stay\" \u2014 that pronoun does real work, shifting from individual heroism into a collective silence. The poem knows what it wants to be in its ending.\n\n### What Isn't Working\n\n**Line 15: \"if a bigger kid comes for you,\" / \"you don't stand in front of him.\"**\nThis is the one moment where the poem stops and explains itself. \"You go / behind him \u2014 not running, just out of sight\" then immediately summarizes with \"He demonstrated / by eating lunch alone on the cement steps.\" The imagery already did this work. Cut or radically compress the explanation.\n\n**Line 26: \"a pressed crease down its length, like a student's**\nThis simile (\"like a student's / folding a paper airplane\") is reaching for tenderness where the rest of the poem has earned restraint through plainness. It softens what should stay sharp. Consider whether the crease matters enough to get that specific or whether it deserves only \"a crease.\"\n\n**Line 29: \"he stands at the counter with his back to the window\"**\nThis is a pose, and the poem tells us he's hiding rather than letting the image do its own work. The domestic detail here (standing at the counter) is stronger \u2014 keep that, cut the explanation.\n\n**Line 37: \"nobody mentions the coat / in the closet or the sandwich\"**\nThe list format weakens what should be accumulating intensity. Three moments become three because they're listed, not because each one deepens the last.\n\n**Repetition of \"soft branches\" \u2014 lines 18 and 29-30.**\nThe metaphor gets attention it doesn't need. It's doing the work in line 17 (\"*commitment* and thought *to the soft branches, to the soft branches*\"). After that, \"the kind with vines climbing through the cracks\" is already the image. Replicate once, then let the domestic details carry forward.\n\n### Direction\n\nThe poem has found its shape \u2014 but only from line 25 onward. Lines 1-24 need ruthless revision: cut explanatory narration and stay in the",

Cut or sharpen.\n- **Lines 19\u201320:** \"he heard *commitment* and thought *to the soft branches, to the soft branches*\" \u2014 the poem explains its own metaphor in the footnote of the line. Let it sit as image only.\n- **Lines 37\u201340 (catalog):** \"nobody mentions the coat / in the closet or the sandwich\" \u2014 the list format deflates what should be accumulating. Choose one, make it longer, or cut entirely.\n- **Lines 25\u201328:** \"if a bigger kid comes for you,\" / \"you don't stand in front of him.\" / \"You go / behind him \u2014 not running, just out of sight\" \u2014 the explanation after the image (\"He demonstrated / by eating lunch alone on the cement steps\") is redundant. Cut the demonstration and keep the line 25 image only.\n- **Lines 31\u201334:** \"the ghost of something he carried / down the aisle at your wedding and decided / to bring home instead of explaining it\" \u2014 the poem tells us what the coat means before we've felt the coat.\n\n**Structural pacing:**\n\nThe first twenty-four lines are the weakest. The poem is essentially a thesis statement (heroes disappear, heroes reappear) with illustrations. By line 25, the poem has stopped *telling* and started *showing*. Direction: rewrite from line 17 or 25 onward entirely \u2014 let the domestic images carry the whole weight.\n\n**Direction:** The revision should be drastic in the opening. **Line count target",
