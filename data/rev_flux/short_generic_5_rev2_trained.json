I mean *before*\u2014the way\na thermometer reads room temperature\nwhen no one has yet walked through.\n\nThere was pressure, like a piston drawn\nto nothing inside a hermetically sealed chamber.\nNot grief. That comes later. This was\nthe molecular equivalent of quiet:\nparticles dispersing into the wavelength\nof what wasn't there to receive them.\n\nI learned about this from a book\u2014\na chapter titled *Sensation Without Stimulus,*\nwhich sounds like something no one would write\nuntil they had to. The body, I've read,\ncan dissolve its own architecture\nat the quantum level. Synapses recycle.\nThe mind becomes a vacuum cleaner\nsuctioning air out of a room it helped empty.\n\nThink subatomic. Think Planck length\u2014\nthe smallest measure possible, which means\neven emptiness has texture: each void\na pixel in a black screen where light\ncould one day appear and be mistaken\nfor the first time.\n\nMy scan showed no gap. I was told this\nas if I'd ordered an MRI for my knees,\nlittle knowing the machine could read\nthe silence between signals, the dark fiber\nwhere data should travel without impediment.\n\nWhat happened wasn't a loss.\nIt was the moment biology understood\nit had always been performing\na trick it never practiced\u2014\nbeing full when every cell in the body\nwas arranged as if expecting something,\nanything, to fill it later.\n\nI don't miss what I've never held.\nBut now I know the temperature of a wall\nin July. I know the pressure\nof being a room before anyone arrives.\n\nAnd here's the strange part: this knowledge\nfeels like a new kind of warmth\u2014\nnot heat but the principle behind it,\nthe way a refrigerator works backwards\nto create cold by moving warm things out.\nI'm learning what it means to be\nefficient at being empty. To recycle\nmyself back into the baseline\nso thoroughly, so systemically,\nthat even my silence has a structure\nno one will later attribute to need.\n\nJust to whatever made me\nbefore I understood I was mine.",
      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe structural pivot at \"I don't mean you\" \u2014 the poem pivots from a third-person allegory into direct address, and that turn carries genuine force. The final three lines (\"Just to whatever made me / before I understood I was mine\") land because they arrive after the poem has earned them through accumulated specificity.\n\nThe image of synapses recycling in the body paragraph is the strongest single stroke \u2014 it's concrete, unexpected, and does real work by connecting quantum mechanics to something as ordinary as memory dissolution. That line shows what this whole piece could do if it trusted itself.\n\nThe \"MRI for my knees\" conceit \u2014 reading silence between signals on a medical metaphorical scan \u2014 has genuine wit and earns its place.\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Abstraction saturation (lines 13\u201327).** The second half of the draft dissolves into pure exposition: subatomic particles, Planck length, vacuum cleaners, dark fiber, quantum level, cold moving warm things out. This is physics lecture material, not poem. A poem about emptiness can't be *entirely* composed of scientific vocabulary \u2014 it risks becoming a vehicle for explanation rather than experience. The reader has to feel the absence through language that makes them physically aware of what's missing, not told about entropy at the subatomic scale.\n\n**Direction:** Strip every line that names a physical concept (subatomic, Planck length, vacuum cleaner, cold moving warm things out). Replace with sensory analogies drawn from lived experience. What does this person *actually* lose? A habit? A sound in a room? A way of walking?\n\n**Clich\u00e9 re-emergence (line 26\u201327).** \"The principle behind it / the way a refrigerator works backwards\" is almost the same as \"I don't mean you\" \u2014 another abstraction dressed in domestic metaphor. It's still talking *about* emptiness rather than embodying it.\n\n**Direction:** Cut to one concrete, unexplained image of what happens when someone who has never felt absence suddenly does. Let that single moment carry everything the poem wants to say about the nature of fullness.\n\n**Prose syntax / lineation (throughout).** The draft is prose organized by paragraph with occasional line breaks doing no work. Short lines or broken syntax \u2014 as the brief directed \u2014 would help, but only if the material inside those lines earns compression. Right now \"I don't miss what I've never held\" exists as a sentence because it's true in thought, not because it's true on the page.\n\n**Direction:** Rewrite the entire piece in short lines (3\u20138 characters average) and see which sentences survive breath control. Force each line to hold an image or sensation \u2014 no sentences doing only exposition.\n\nThe angle is sound: loss through a person who never knew empt",

      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe opening image \u2014 \"a leg of wood / moves slightly\" in a forgotten chair \u2014 is the strongest moment: concrete, particular, and strange enough to carry the entire poem forward without explanation. It trusts the reader. The line \"the vent pushes warm air / against the grout lines, / moving nothing\" earns its place because it's doing sensory work through temperature and texture where the draft was reaching for abstraction.\n\nThe closing image \u2014 \"a lake freezes over / what wasn't there to freeze\" \u2014 lands with genuine strangeness. It's a single line that does more interpretive labor than nearly every paragraph of the previous drafts, and it succeeds because it's grounded in physical reality (water freezing only where cold meets surface).\n\nThe poem knows how to be quiet.\n\n---\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Abstraction replacing image (lines 13\u201327).** The second half abandons the domestic, sensory world that works and enters a cloud of physics terminology: subatomic particles, Planck length, vacuum cleaners, dark fiber, quantum level. \"Think subatomic\" is the poem telling itself to do what it hasn't yet done \u2014 which means the poet needs more images in this section.\n\n**Direction:** Cut every line containing a scientific concept that doesn't appear as an embodied image elsewhere in the poem. If the reader can't see or feel the emptiness through language, replace the abstraction with another concrete detail drawn from the domestic world already established (the room, the body, water, air).\n\n**Expository drift (lines 17\u201323).** \"I've read / the body, I've read\" \u2014 this reads like a lecture. The poem stops showing and starts summarizing what it means to be empty.\n\n**Direction:** Cut every sentence that explains the poem's own metaphor. Let the images do that work. If you need to summarize at any point, rewrite as an image instead: \"the vent pushes warm air / against the grout lines\" is already a summary of heat becoming thought \u2014 but it doesn't say so.\n\n**Redundancy and circularity (lines 13\u201327).** The draft circles back on itself (\"molecular equivalent,\" \"dark fiber,\" \"nothing now \u2014 full\") without advancing. Each return adds nothing new to the reader's experience.\n\n**Direction:** Every line should either introduce a fresh image or deepen an existing one. If a line restates what came before, it has no reason to exist.\n\n**Lineation as prose (throughout).** The draft is organized in prose paragraphs with occasional breaks that do no work \u2014 no enjambment creates tension, no short lines force compression. Short lines are the poem's real tool here; the draft hasn't yet committed to using them.\n\n**Direction:** Rewrite the entire piece in short lines (3\u20138 characters average). Force each line to",
