      "draft": "In autumn's sighs, where leaves descend,\nThey say the bonds grow tight in death;\nThe roots of family extend.\nThrough winter chill and spring's delight,\nWhere life on life both gives and takes,\nEach parting, like a branch uprooted.\n\nUpon these branches sprout new shoots,\nOf memories that intertwine.\nThough seasons shift from cold to heat,\nIn every leaf we hold our kin.\nAnd when the frost of silence seeps\nBeneath the bark where once we swam,\nWe find what love can truly claim.\n\nThe roots, they whisper through their crevices,\nAnd in those cracks, a new life breeds;\nFor even as old leaves do disperse,\nNew ones will rise from fertile seeds.\nThus, when the winds of change caress\nThis earth, within our hearts abide:\nOur bonds remain where once we died.",
      "critique": "### What Works:\n- The imagery of autumn leaves and the cycle of seasons effectively symbolizes the passage of time and the enduring nature of familial bonds.\n- The villanelle structure provides a reflective tone, which aligns well with the theme of legacy and memory.\n\n### Issues (Type, Location, Direction):\n1. **Rhyme Scheme Deviations:**\n   - **Lines 4, 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 18:** These lines do not follow the expected rhyme scheme of ABA. Suggest revising these to ensure they align with the villanelle form.\n     - Example: Change \"delight\" (line 4) to \"tight,\" and \"uprooted\" (line 6) to \"extend.\"\n2. **Meter Variations:**\n   - The poem has some spondees, pyrrhics, and trochees that deviate from the expected iambic pentameter.\n     - Example: In line 1, change \"In autumn's sighs\" to \"In autumn's breaths,\" which maintains an iambic meter.\n\n### Directions:\n- **Revise Rhyme Scheme:** Ensure each stanza follows the ABA pattern. For instance, in the first stanza, revise lines 4 and 6 as suggested.\n- **Improve Meter:** Focus on maintaining a consistent iambic pentameter by replacing spondees, pyrrhics, and trochees with iambs where possible.\n\n### Workshop Response:\nIn \"Generation,\" you effectively use natural imagery to explore the themes of death\u2019s impact on familial bonds. The villanelle structure provides a reflective tone that complements your subject matter. However, there are some issues with the rhyme scheme and meter that need addressing:\n\n1. **Rhyme Scheme:** The current scheme deviates from the expected ABA pattern in several lines. For example, \"delight\" (line 4) should be revised to \"tight,\" and \"uprooted\" (line 6) should be changed to \"extend.\" This will help maintain the formal structure of the villanelle.\n2. **Meter:** The poem has some variations from iambic pentameter, such as spondees in lines 1 and 2. Consider changing these to iambs for consistency.\n\nBy addressing these issues, you can ensure that your poem adheres more closely to the form while maintaining its thematic depth.\n\n### When Done:\nThis poem has found its shape.",
