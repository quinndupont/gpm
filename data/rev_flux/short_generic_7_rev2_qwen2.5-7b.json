      "draft": "In the weave of an unspoken word,\nVibrations dance, unheard.\nSkin feels the whispering air,\nEyes seek a shadowed pair.\n\nEchoes linger in corners deep,\nWhere sound once played and crept.\nA hum from muted lips\u2014\nNot silence, but dissonant whispers, slips.\n\nFootsteps tread on floors that moan,\nTheir reverberation alone.\nIn this space where voice is strangled,\nVoids fill with whispered slander.\n\nVoices trapped in walls of stone,\nResonate in hidden tone.\nEach breath a testament to sound's absence\u2014\nA silent rebellion, an unheard resistance.",
      "critique": "What's Alive:\n- The exploration of silence as a form of resistance or defiance is compelling and unique.\n- The imagery of vibrations dancing, unheard whispers, and the tactile experience of sound waves against skin adds depth to the poem.\n\nIssues:\n1. **Weak Line Breaks**: Lines like \"Skin feels the whispering air\" and \"A hum from muted lips\u2014\" are too long and can be broken into shorter lines or split differently to enhance the rhythm.\n2. **Clich\u00e9 Phrases**: The line \"A moment's pause\" is a clich\u00e9 that could be replaced with more vivid imagery.\n3. **Overly Abstract Language**: Some phrases like \"unspoken word,\" \"whispering air,\" and \"reverberation alone\" are abstract and can be made more concrete.\n\nDirections:\n1. Break the lines to enhance rhythm, for example: \n   - \"Skin feels / the whispering air.\"\n2. Replace clich\u00e9s with fresh imagery: \n   - Change \"A moment's pause\" to something like \"a hush that clings.\"\n3. Make abstract language more concrete by specifying what the silence is resisting or defying:\n   - Instead of \"unspoken word,\" consider \"words unuttered, thoughts untold.\"\n\nWhen these adjustments are made, this poem has found its shape.",
