  "final_poem": "In whispers of laughter and shared secrets we find,  \nA bond like no other\u2014the purest form of gold I've ever seen: friendship is timelessly kind.  \nTrue friends walk with us through thick or thin streams; in their company you\u2019d forever beam \u2014   \nWith them by my side the burdens dissolve into light beams, as time weaves its endless ream\u2014 \nTheir presence a constant source of solace and cheerfulness.  \nWarm hugs to mend tears within your heart's searer; their laughter echoes in every prayer I hear (A)    \nIn the silence when fear\u2019s whispers creep, these allies provide courage not cheap\u2014 \nThey stand steadfast by my side with tender care and love \u2014  \nTo face life together is a gift beyond compare.   \nNo matter where we roam or what trials are rife; in unity they make our spirits thrive (B)    \nLaughter shared, tears to wipe away the day\u2019s bite\u2014 \nA friendship that transcends time and strife:  \nFriendship's gift is such an unforeseen delight.   \nThey stand by me when I falter or fall \u2014 in need of strength divine (C)    \nThrough every season, under heaven\u2019s endless skies\u2014 \nTo bear your burdens and embrace without a shroud:  \nFriendship's gift is such an unforeseen delight.   \nIn trials we rise as one \u2014 in joys too when hearts are tight (D)    \nThrough their loyalty, I find the strength to endure\u2014 \nFor them alone my heart finds solace and light;  \nFriendship\u2019s gift is such an unforeseen delight.   \nA beacon through life's darkest night \u2014 when shadows do conspire (C)    \nTo lift me up, even as I falter or fall\u2014 \nThey share the load with open arms that bind:  \nFriendship\u2019s gift is such an unforeseen delight.   \nIn unity they make my spirit strong; never to be denied \u2014 a friend for whom no price doth weigh heavy (D)    \nWith them, I find solace in their warm embrace\u2014 \nFor as long enduring stars shine bright:  \nFriendship\u2019s gift is such an unforeseen delight.   \nUnchained from fear's darkened spite \u2014 together they stand; within our souls we light (B)    \nThrough storm and sun, through loss or gain\u2014 \nTheir presence in my heart will always remain:  \nFriendship\u2019s gift is such an unforeseen delight.   \nA priceless bond that'll last a lifetime \u2014 their worth beyond all price (C)    \nBeyond this life and time, when silence may claim; \nThey are the treasure in my heart to keep:  \nFriendship\u2019s gift is such an unforeseen delight.   \nIn you they find me whole again\u2014in love's embrace we bask (D)     ",
