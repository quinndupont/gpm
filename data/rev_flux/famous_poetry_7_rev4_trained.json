      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe poem has genuine structural ambition \u2014 the engine-compartment conceit is doing real work, and the central idea (loss of control before anyone notices) lands with force. The turn signal near the end (\"I can see my own breath / doing its small work in the glass\") is a sharp moment: it earns its abstraction by grounding it in breath fogging a window. That's where trust between image and meaning happens.\n\nThe line \"the steering wheel is a thing I'm hugging\" has physical specificity \u2014 it resists sentimentalizing the scene, which is what most road poems do at this point.\n\nThe closing four lines (\"*here we part,* which is / less than a quote and more / the sound a river makes / when it finally understands / it was never yours to hold\") arrive after enough earned material that they don't quite collapse into aphorism. The river line at least tries something different from what's expected.\n\nThe poem is strongest in its first 25 lines \u2014 roughly the engine-compartment and early fog sections. That's where the poet has stayed inside the car, stayed inside the situation, and stayed close to actual sensory data.\n\n---\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Sentimentality / emotional over-explanation (lines 43\u201350):**\n\"Meaning will find me later, tucked\nin bed, the car a story I can't recall,\nmy hands still posed like someone\nholding positions they won't remember taking.\"\nThis paragraph *tells* what the poem has already shown. The hands hugging the steering wheel (line 4) and the body's refusal to give an inch (line 12) are doing the work here. The explanation weakens it by naming \"meaning\" as a concept rather than letting the image hold weight.\n\n**Direction:** Cut or compress this passage entirely. Let the hands be remembered only through their physicality \u2014 not through self-commentary about remembering.\n\n---\n\n**Clich\u00e9 / dead language:**\n- \"a flavor, almost-banana, almost-blackberry\" \u2014 three near-misses in a row for the same abstraction (taste). This is the poem reaching for something it hasn't committed to yet.\n- \"mad rabbit away\" \u2014 personification that's decorative rather than earned\n- \"fog all the way to the shoulders\" \u2014 vague spatial language. What does fog do at the shoulder? Say that.\n- \"the knowledge that every stop / was just a temporary decision / to stop knowing.\" \u2014 this is the poem explaining its own theme back to itself, which kills tension.\n\n**Direction:** Each of these moments needs to be cut or replaced with something observed, not generalized. What does fog actually do at the edge of pavement? What's the texture of wet glass under wiper blades when it's cold \u2014 say that in a line and stop.\n\n---\n\n**Abstraction",

      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n---\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe engine-compartment conceit is genuinely compelling, and the poem lands with real force in its first two-thirds.\n\n**Line 3: \"My left hand hovers like a thing / I'm hugging while driving.\"** \u2014 This is the strongest opening line because it earns physical specificity before any abstraction arrives. The steering wheel as something held.\n\n**Lines 15\u201320:** \"Weeds along the shoulder bend / the wrong direction. The mirage / of exit ramps and painted lines / smiles at us with cracked teeth\" \u2014 this is where attention lands on actual road imagery, not sentiment. \"Smiles at us with cracked teeth\" earns its grotesquerie.\n\n**Lines 23\u201325:** \"The fog thins where headlights push through it,\nlike cracked fingernail polish peeling from a nail.\" \u2014 The fog as something that *peels* is precise and visual, not decorative. This line does what the whole poem should do: show rather than tell.\n\n**Lines 47\u201350:** \"I can see my own breath / doing its small work in the glass.\" \u2014 The river line tries something different (a closing metaphor of separation) that actually works because it arrives after enough grounded sensory material. The final image earns its abstraction (\"here we part\") by staying physical.\n\n**\"Tire smoke left behind is not a choice\u2014it's heat,\"** \u2014 the poem's central conceit gets stated with real economy in line 38, and the rest of that sentence (cut from previous draft) completes it: \"rubber returning to what it was before it became interesting.\" That's precise.\n\n---\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Sentimentality / emotional over-explanation (lines 37\u201340):**\n\"Meaning will find me later, tucked\nin bed, the car a story I can't recall,\nmy hands still posed like someone\nholding positions they won't remember taking.\"\nThis is the poem explaining its own theme back to itself. It kills tension and replaces image with abstraction.\n\n**Direction:** Cut entirely or replace with something that stays in the physical scene \u2014 what are the hands actually doing, where are they resting? The steering wheel already did this work.\n\n---\n\n**Abstraction / dead language:**\n\n- **\"some guitar thread, the kind of note you find / in fog and mistake for it.\"** \u2014 Three near-misses for a single abstraction. Cut or commit.\n- **\"That particular animal sound,\nwet leather stripping from wet asphalt\u2014\"\n\"leather\" is vague; what surface? What texture?\n- **\"the mad rabbit away: sixty, sixty-one\"** \u2014 personification that's decorative rather than earned\n- **\"all of it sliding off the lens at sixty miles per second\"** \u2014 this is the poet explaining what the road does. The image",

  "final_poem": "A station's one guitar string\nrides the frequency I half-remember losing\u2014\nnot a note, but the accident of it,\nthe way rain smooths glass into something you mistake for silence.\n\nMy left hand opens around the wheel like a fist\nletting go of its last grip on anything clean. Rain on windscreen.\nA fox yaps in the shoulder weeds, three hundred feet from us,\nbut that sound arrives already broken, the way language is\nwhen it crosses fields at night and returns changed.\n\nI don't ease off when the steering's pulled past hard.\nMy knuckles go white then loose their grip like a held breath\u2014\nthat particular soft letting-go you can feel in the tendons\njust below the wrist. The dashboard tick:\nspeedo's rabbit hopping its small legs toward sixty,\nthen sixty-one, and outside: fog drawn back to texture,\nroad dissolving under it like hair pulling from a scalp that's cooled.\n\nOn the right, the shoulder's dark with wet grass.\nA weed bends so fully sideways I can see\nthe soil inside it, the bright gut of it\nclosing its small mouth around the wind\u2014each leaf\ndoing this individually, fiercely. My wipers scrape rain and fluid\nacross one thin sheet of window where headlights push through the fog\nlike cracked fingernail polish peeling from a nail.\n\nI don't correct. The tire smoke left behind is not a choice\u2014it's heat,\nrubber returning to what it was before it became interesting.\nThat black smear tells me nothing about direction, but I watch it anyway.\n\nThe turn signal clicks its one silver tooth\ninto the plastic socket. Fog all the way now\u2014\nmy own breath fogging the left side window in small, careful circles,\neach one erased by the wiper before it sets.\nWipers scrape and windscreen holds what's left: that thin sheet of water\nyou can read through even when moving fast.\n\nHeadlights push back the fog like a coat\nsliding off a sleeping body. Each steady turn signal ahead\na redness clean as something handed to you, not chosen\u2014\njust held at the wrist, weight in the hand,\nthe way you hold anything that isn't leaving.\nThe wiper blade finds its groove again and I let it pull\nfog from glass like cracked polish lifting from a nail.",
