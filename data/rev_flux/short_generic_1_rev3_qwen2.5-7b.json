      "draft": "In the hollows where my feet sink deep,\nthe grains of sand, worn smooth like years,\nwhisper secrets soft as morning mist.\nEach grain a memory, each whisper a song.\n\nA hand to dip into that brine-slicked basin\u2014\nwhere water and earth merge in unspoken speech.\nThe salt tastes of the old sea, ancient and knowing,\ncrystallized time, held aloft on a breeze.\n\nBeneath my fingers, layers of history laid bare:\nshells from distant shores, tiny worlds packed tight,\ntheir smooth backsides worn by tides that never rest.\nThese are not just relics but stories\u2014\ntales untold where salt and sand conspire to keep them silent.\n\nIn the grip of a mother\u2019s hand on the beach at dawn,\nthe sand so cold it bites like time itself.\nThe sea, vast in its quietness, cradling the world within,\na maternal embrace that holds back nothing but memories.\n\nThese hands once held onto life as small fingers tightened around rocks\u2014\nstones left to mark moments of joy or sorrow, triumphs and losses alike.\nIn each pinch, a heartbeat\u2014a pulse of what it means to be human here,\namongst salt-laden air and grains that shift like shifting shadows.\n\nThe ocean\u2019s taste is in my bones now, ingrained as if by blood\u2014\na salty tang that runs deep through veins untold. \nIt flows with the tides within me, pushing back against silence.\nEach wave a whisper of what was, what might be; each break a sigh,\nas the sea releases its load to the world once more and again.",
      "critique": "What works:\n- The tactile experiences of sand and salt are vividly captured, creating a strong sensory foundation.\n- Personal anecdotes add depth and specificity to the broader theme.\n\nIssues:\n1. **Weak Line Breaks**: Some lines feel too long or lack necessary breaks that could enhance the rhythm and pacing.\n   - Example: \"In each pinch, a heartbeat\u2014a pulse of what it means to be human here,\" could benefit from a break after \"pulse\" for emphasis.\n   \n2. **Overly Abstract Phrasing**: Certain phrases are abstract and could be more concrete or specific.\n   - Example: \"Each grain a memory, each whisper a song.\" This is poetic but can feel too abstract without more detail.\n\n3. **Sentimentality**: The poem leans towards sentimentality in places, which might detract from the raw, tactile experience of the ocean.\n   - Example: \"A maternal embrace that holds back nothing but memories.\" While evocative, it could be more grounded in sensory details.\n\nDirections:\n- Revise line breaks to create a more rhythmic flow. For instance, break lines at key moments like after \"pulse\" and \"here.\"\n- Replace abstract phrases with specific imagery. For example, instead of \"Each grain a memory,\" try something like: \"Each grain holds the weight of days spent on distant shores.\"\n- Reduce sentimentality by focusing more on concrete sensations. For example, replace \"A maternal embrace that holds back nothing but memories\" with: \"The sand\u2019s cool grip, a reminder of hands held tight in dawn\u2019s first light.\"\n\nWhen done:\nThis poem has found its shape.",
