      "draft": "The woods hum a hymn of frozen breath  \nsnow lies thick, a blanket of unspoken vows  \nmy hands, warm as guilt, clutch splinters of forgotten names  \neach step crunches the weight of what I did not say  \nthe pines lean close, their boughs like fingers tracing the edges of a promise I buried  \nsnow erases the trail, but not the echo of my name  \nI stay, a ghost in the grammar of the wild  \nwhere silence is a language I cannot speak",
      "critique": "**What\u2019s alive:**  \nThe poem successfully contrasts the cold\u2019s numbing effect with the heat of unresolved guilt. The snow is a metaphor for erasure (\u201cblanket of unspoken vows,\u201d \u201cerases the trail\u201d) and the pines\u2019 \u201cfingers\u201d trace a buried promise. Enjambment and jagged lines mirror unresolved tension. The closing image of the speaker as a \u201cghost in the grammar of the wild\u201d ties the natural world to internal silence.  \n\n**Issues:**  \n- **Abstraction**: \u201cThe woods hum a hymn of frozen breath\u201d relies on overused metaphor (\u201chymn,\u201d \u201chum\u201d) and lacks visceral specificity.  \n- **Weak line",
