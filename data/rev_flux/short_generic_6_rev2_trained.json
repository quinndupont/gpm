      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### What's Alive\n\nThe poem has genuine structural intelligence. The shift from \"Forearm lengthens\" to the closing quatrain \u2014 \"not complaining / \u2026 stops doing certain things, / starts\" \u2014 creates a body-as-witness architecture that earns its final abstraction because it arrives after a long accumulation of physical detail. The closing line lands precisely where it should.\n\nThe best single passage: \"Eyes make slits / at six am. Not tired. / Just closed too long.\" That \"Just closed too long\" does real work \u2014 it resists easy pathos by naming the habit, not the feeling. The tongue sequence (\"thickens / against teeth that move / a little, then less, / then nothing at all\") also earns its effect through incremental specificity rather than emotional instruction.\n\nThe poem is strongest when it stays inside the body and trusts the reader to feel scale from texture alone.\n\n### What Isn't Working\n\n**Clich\u00e9 proximity (line 1):** \"by fractions of a millimeter each year after twenty\" \u2014 this reads like a fact sheet, not poetry. It's accurate but inert. The poem is better when it *enacts* measurement through image. Direction: Cut or replace with something that physically embodies the smallness.\n\n**Abstraction creeping in (line 10):** \"the way stone widens / in a crack left open too long\" \u2014 this moves toward metaphor explanation rather than lived experience. The poem is stronger when it stays inside the body's own vocabulary. Direction: Stay with the body's own materials and processes. Stone widening feels borrowed.\n\n**Sentimentality (line 16-20):** \"where years stack on / like bricks left in the rain too long.\" This is the weakest phrase cluster \u2014 stacked bricks as metaphor for aging has been worn smooth. The rain-on-bricks image adds nothing the preceding line didn't already do with \"wider, especially / at the temples\" (which works). Direction: Strip the simile entirely or find one that doesn't echo common wall-falling-down language.\n\n**Redundancy:** \"not complaining\" appears twice in close succession (\"He is not complaining. / The body doesn't complain.\") \u2014 the second instance softens what the first was trying to assert with force. Direction: Merge into one line or cut entirely; the poem's real argument about bodily acceptance is more interesting than a named emotional denial.\n\n**Line 24-25:** \"It simply / stops doing certain things, / starts\" \u2014 the enjambment here flattens what could be a genuine syntactic disruption. The short lines are doing real",

      "critique": "## Revision Workshop Response\n\n---\n\n### What's Alive\n\nThe closing quatrain \u2014 \"not complaining / \u2026 stops doing certain things, / starts / doing others\" \u2014 is the poem's real engine. It earns its abstraction by arriving after a sustained accumulation of physical detail. The body-as-witness conceit is genuinely well-constructed: each part of the face and extremity gets its own stanza, and the syntax in the final section breaks down with purpose.\n\nThe tongue sequence (\"thickens / against teeth that move / a little, then less, / then nothing at all\") works because it enacts rather than explains. The incremental verbs \u2014 *move* \u2192 *less* \u2192 *nothing at all* \u2014 do more narrative work than any line of the draft before it.\n\n\"Skull sutures forget what holding meant\" is precise and strange in just the right way, without reaching for explanation.\n\n---\n\n### What Isn't Working\n\n**Line 1: \"Forearm lengthens / by fractions of a millimeter each year after twenty.\"**\n- **Issue:** This reads like a fact sheet. It tells rather than shows. The poem's best lines are *enacting* measurement through image, not stating it.\n- **Direction:** Cut or replace with something that physically embodies the smallness \u2014 a sleeve riding up on a wrist, say.\n\n**Line 10: \"the way stone widens / in a crack left open\"**\n- **Issue:** This moves toward metaphor explanation rather than lived experience. The poem is stronger when it stays inside the body's own materials.\n- **Direction:** Stay with bone or tendon \u2014 the poem's own tissue-language.\n\n**Line 16: \"Just closed too long.\"**\n- **Issue:** This resists pathos by naming habit, which is actually working well \u2014 but the next line (\"the opening / is a small\") weakens it.\n- **Direction:** Keep \"Just closed too long\" and cut \"small,\" letting the slit-as-slit image do its own scaling.\n\n**Line 20: \"like bricks left in the rain too long.\"**\n- **Issue:** This simile adds nothing the preceding line (\"wider, especially / at the temples\") didn't already accomplish. The rain-on-bricks is a clich\u00e9 dressed as image.\n- **Direction:** Remove entirely or find a comparison that doesn't echo wall-falling-down language.\n\n**Line 24: \"It simply\"**\n- **Issue:** This softens what the preceding line (\"stops doing certain things\") was trying to assert with force. The enjambment here flattens rather than disrupts.\n- **Direction:** Rebuild the syntax so the final lines genuinely fracture \u2014 let the reader feel the body's strangeness without the poem explaining it.\n\n**Line 25: \"starts / doing others.\"**\n- **Issue:** The line break splits a verb that already fragmented. It could be working",
