      "critique": "**What\u2019s alive:**  \nThe imagery of the cracked mug and faded ink effectively conveys the persistence of memory without abstraction. The roots metaphor subtly mirrors the unseen foundation of friendship. The enjambment and line breaks create a rhythm that mirrors the quiet, unbroken flow of time. The final lines about trust outlasting its name are precise and avoid sentimentality.  \n\n**Issues:**  \n- **Clich\u00e9:** \"Still holding the heat of your last cup of tea\" leans on overused sensory language. Replace \"heat\" with \"warmth\" for freshness.  \n- **Weak line break:** \"Still lingers in the margin / of my notebook\" splits a compound idea awkwardly. Merge into a single line for clarity.  \n- **Abstraction:** \"The clock grew tired of ticking\" is vague. Replace with \"stilled its ticking\" for concrete imagery.  \n- **Weak line break:** \"Empty as a sentence / left mid-paragraph\" splits a metaphor unnecessarily. Consolidate into one line for impact.  \n\n**Direction:**  \nRevise \"heat\" to \"warmth,\" adjust \"pools in the margin\" to \"still lingers in the margin,\" and replace \"grew tired of ticking\"",
