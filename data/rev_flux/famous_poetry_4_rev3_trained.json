      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe elevator shaft ending is the most alive moment in the poem. \"It looks like exit number one from your camera's view\" \u2014 that's precise, unflattering surveillance language doing real work: it makes Death look like a security system rather than a person. The final image of trying to keep \"the second floor lights on just a little longer\" earns its place because the poem has been building toward something physical and specific.\n\nThe clock inside the helmet (line 17) is another strong detail \u2014 it's concrete, visual, and does what the imagery brief asked for: it puts time inside a figure who controls access. That's the poem thinking through its own metaphor rather than just decorating it.\n\nThe repetition of \"deny\" in lines 25\u201328 has rhythmic pressure without feeling forced. The escalation from deny \u2192 deny *cleaner* is subtle but effective \u2014 the doorman's precision is being revealed as a kind of impatience.\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Clich\u00e9 and dead language (throughout):**\n\"Efficient, and the two are nearly identical\" \u2014 this is the poem explaining its own metaphor to the reader instead of letting it breathe. The doorman's efficiency *is* his lack of pride; the line states the thesis rather than demonstrating it through action or image.\n\"Ruts deepening in the hallways\" \u2014 this reads like a stock phrase for a noir poem, not one that belongs inside a sleep-as-access-metaphor. It feels borrowed from somewhere else entirely.\n\"The body's calve / gone flat like a card turned face down on the table\" \u2014 \"calve\" is misspelled (calf), and the simile to a card doesn't land because it's too close in texture to what the poem already has (the actual card being held open at chest level). Cut or replace.\n\"The woman who couldn't wake, / who asked for hospice at the desk\" \u2014 this is narrative exposition. It tells us she was dying without earning that information through image or action. If she's not central, cut her; if she's central, build around her.\n\"I know your rotation\u2014how you swap\" \u2014 \"know your rotation\" is vague and self-important. What does the speaker *actually* know? Show it.\n\n**Structural pacing:**\nThe poem has two distinct sections that don't yet connect smoothly. The first 24 lines establish the doorman metaphor; the second half dramatizes negotiation with it. But there's no bridge between them \u2014 no moment where the metaphor hits the floor and the speaker tries to act on it. Right now it reads as setup followed by extended argument. The poem needs a turn, a point of no return, before the \"could you please\" plea. Something has to happen that *forces* the final gesture.\n\n**Line breaks (",

      "critique": "## Revision Workshop Response\n\n---\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe elevator shaft ending is the strongest moment: \"It looks like exit number one from your camera's view.\" That line earns its place because it shifts perspective \u2014 Death becomes a surveillance system, not a person. The final gesture of asking to keep lights on also works; it's concrete and emotionally grounded.\n\nThe clock inside the helmet (line 17) is precise: time made physical inside an authority figure. \"Scan it. Deny it. Scan it again. Deny it cleaner.\" The repetition here has rhythmic pressure without feeling like filler \u2014 each denial gets starker, and the doorman's efficiency becomes his refusal in a single action.\n\nThe scene is strongest when it stays inside the body-as-card metaphor: \"gone flat like a card turned face down on the table,\" \"held open at chest level like a palm full of evidence.\" These are specific. Even \"calve\" corrected to \"calf\" in revision shows attention to detail that matters.\n\n---\n\n### 2.

The poem's angle (death-as-doorman) is interesting but buried under stock language. **Direction:** Cut or rewrite entirely.

If the woman matters, build around her; if not, cut. **Direction:** Remove entirely.\n\n**Abstraction where image should be (line 21):**\n\"The body's calve / gone flat like a card turned face down on the table\" \u2014 \"calve\" is misspelled and the simile to a card doesn't advance the metaphor; it echoes what was already said. **Direction:** Cut or replace with something that stays inside the access-card logic (a doorknob, a slot, a fingerprint).\n\n**Telling where showing is needed (lines 25\u201331):**\n\"you don't have a name. / You don't answer to negotiation.\" \u2014 this states Death's powerlessness rather than demonstrating it through action or image. \"You're efficient, and the two are nearly identical\" does the same: explains the metaphor instead of letting repetition *be* the demonstration. **Direction:** Replace both with scenes.

I know your rotation\u2014how you swap\nyour post like a shift in convenience stores,\npale and professional, never looking up.\n\nI have tried the lobby.\nThe emergency exit is locked too.\nThere's a clock inside your helmet\nticking toward 5:17\u2014a minute precise,\nnot midnight but something lower\u2014the body's calf\ngone flat like a card turned face down on the table.\n\nYou answer me the way you answered her\u2014diligent,\nmethodical, no empathy required.\n\nI tried the lobby again. The doors swished shut\nbefore I reached them. I am not applying\nfor early release. I am already out past curfew,\nalready grazing floor tiles for warmth,\n\nand you are standing in your fluorescent\narena, scanning barcodes, refusing\nthe read card held open at chest level like a\npalm full of evidence.\n\nWe could negotiate terms.\nI could sign away the hours\nyou can't reach yet\u2014eleven p.m., eleven-thirty,\nnow, now, now\u2014the ruts would deepen. You don't need them to.\n\nBut here's the catch: you don't have a name.\nYou don't answer to negotiation.\nAnd that, more than anything,\nis why I keep coming back.\n\nI show you this card\u2014\na thin transparent laminate no one asks for,\njust something in your manual\nthat might help with late arrivals who won't leave.\nYou scan it. Deny it.\nScan it again. Deny it cleaner.\n\nThat's when I notice: you're not proud.\nYou're efficient, and the two are nearly identical.\nYou don't *want* me here. You just want the door\nto close at 5 a.m., no exceptions,\nand I keep forgetting that my body is\nnothing more insistent than an open door.\n\nSo I'll try the elevator shaft next.\nIt looks like exit number one from your camera's view\n\nbut first: could you please, as a matter of policy,\nkeep the second floor lights on just a little longer?\n*Just a little.*",
