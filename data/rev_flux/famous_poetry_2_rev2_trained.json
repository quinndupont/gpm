Which means the thing\nhe came here to listen for was never separate\u2014\nit was always just the sound of water\non itself, the way two silences overlap\n\nand what lies between them is not meaning\nbut the engine room where water sits,\nholding its one great stillness, waiting\nfor something to pass through.",
      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### What's Alive\n\nThe central conceit \u2014 a raven appearing underwater, in a hospital tank, speaking the word \"fog\" as an acoustic event rather than an expression of grief \u2014 is genuinely compelling. The poem earns its strangeness through specific physical detail: \"pressure crushes the gill-edges flat,\" \"the trachea has narrowed to its own idea / of sound.\" These lines do real work; they make you feel the collapse of air before naming it.\n\nThe passage beginning at line 17 (\"For now it is enough\") has the poem's strongest momentum. The shift from description into something almost narrative \u2014 a man in a sterile room, water around him, pumps humming off-frequency \u2014 gives the reader a body and a place to inhabit. \"It keeps saying *fog* again\" lands hard because of what precedes it.\n\nThe word \"fog\" doing double duty as both noun and verb (\"the word is not a response. It is an object / dropped into a basin where sound ends\") shows the poet thinking through language rather than past it.\n\n### What Isn't Working\n\n**Rhyme overrunning meaning (lines 31\u201347).** The poem's stated goal is minimal structure, no imposed rhyme scheme \u2014 but then lines 29 to 36 introduce a near-perfect ABAB rhyme (\"passage\" / \"fog,\" \"overlap\" / \"separate,\" \"engine room\" / \"room\") that undermines the anti-rhyme directive. The word \"separate\" is doing double duty as a rhyme word and as meaning, which means it's getting two jobs at once in service of form rather than content. **Direction:** Strip all end-rhymes from lines 29\u201336. Let repetition emerge through syntax and compression alone.\n\n**Excessive explanation (lines 14\u201318).** \"The man here\u2014is he a man? He floats / somewhere behind a closed eyelid, somewhere\" \u2014 this is the poet narrating their own thinking for the reader. The raven saying *fog* underwater already does the work of meaninglessness and strangeness; the question mark after \"man\" tells us what to feel before we've encountered it. **Direction:** Cut lines 14\u201318 entirely or compress them drastically \u2014 one line maximum, no rhetorical flourish.\n\n**Punctuation as decoration (throughout).** The asterisks around words (\"*fog*\", \"*current*\", \"*deeper*\") and the em dashes doing heavy lifting throughout create a visual texture that reads as emphasis rather than necessity. In \"What the body learns / to almost ignore,\" the slash after \"ignore\" is doing something no line break should do \u2014 it's telling the reader where to pause for breath, not letting the syntax manage pacing. **Direction:** Remove all punctuation except commas and periods. Let lines end on syntactic weight.\n\n**The",

      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### What's Alive\n\nThe opening four lines establish the raven underwater with real authority. \"Water thickens past sound\" is precise, strange, and earns its place. The image of a bird suspended inside a tank, beak against valve skin, does more conceptual work than any other passage in the poem \u2014 it sets up the entire argument without explaining it.\n\nThe word \"fog\" as an acoustic object rather than grief-utterance arrives early and is the strongest engine here: fog means something underwater; fog is what you hear when air collapses. That's the poem's real subject, and it lands hard because of concrete language.\n\nLines 17\u201323 (the man in the sterile room) are the first place the poem risks becoming a poem about grief. The shift from bird to man is structurally sound, but \"he doesn't cry\" arrives as explanation rather than image. That's where the poem starts narrating its own meaning.\n\n### What Isn't Working\n\n**Rhyme and near-rhyme (lines 14\u201329).** The rhyme scheme \u2014 ABAB quatrains with slant rhymes (\"flat\"/\"ratchet,\" \"skin\"/\"inflation\") \u2014 is doing work that undermines the anti-rhyme directive. \"Inflation\" / \"underwater\" and \"again\" / \"fog\" (repeated) are near-perfect pairs that read as imposed structure, not discovered ones. **Direction:** Strip all end-rhymes from lines 14\u201329. Let repetition of \"fog\" emerge through syntax alone \u2014 say it once or twice in the passage without rhyme forcing its return.\n\n**Excessive explanation and narration (lines 13\u201318).** \"Is he a man?\" / \"somewhere behind a closed eyelid, somewhere\" \u2014 this is the poet narrating their own thinking for the reader. Cut lines 14\u201318 entirely or compress them to one line maximum.\n\n**Punctuation as emphasis (throughout).** The asterisks around fog and the em dashes doing heavy lifting create visual weight that substitutes for earned intensity. **Direction:** Remove all punctuation except commas and periods. Let syntax manage pacing.\n\n**Tense confusion in lines 27\u201336.** \"The man here\u2014is he a man?\" shifts to past tense (\"has learned,\" \"stays regular\") without justification, then returns to present. The siren passage (lines 31\u201335) lurches between past and present with no structural reason. **Direction:** Decide: is this poem in narrative flashback or present tense observation? Commit.\n\n**Redundancy / padding (lines 27\u201336).** \"The man here\u2014is he a man?\" / \"how his body has grown accustomed\" \u2014 these are the poet narrating their own meaning again. \"The raven does not know him\" is already",
