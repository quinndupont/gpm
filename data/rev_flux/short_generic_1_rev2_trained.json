      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### What's Alive\n\nThe central conceit \u2014 earthquake as revealed through tectonic movement in water, not land \u2014 is genuinely original.

It's unexpected, specific, and strange in just the way this piece needs to be. The final image (ocean \"waiting\") has genuine tension without explaining itself.\n\nThe fragmentation works structurally: each sentence as an earthquake reading on a screen.
