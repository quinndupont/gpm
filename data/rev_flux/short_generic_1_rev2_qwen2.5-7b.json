      "draft": "Between grains, time whispers,\nA soft murmur that stirs from beneath.\nFingers trace a map no chart can read\u2014\nRidges and hollows etched in sand's embrace.\n\nSeagulls screech in distant echoes,\nTheir calls piercing the quietude of twilight.\nAbove, stars twinkle with memories\nFaded yet still burnished by old light.\n\nDipping toes, we feel the pulse beneath,\nA current that runs as deep as our dreams.\nWaves rise, then withdraw like silent sighs\u2014\nEach one a story whispered into night's embrace.\n\nIn these waves, I seek my past,\nFractured fragments washed to shore.\nYet, with every turn of tide and ebb,\nMy grasp on what once was grows thinner still.",
      "critique": "What works:\n- The metaphor of the ocean as a memory is strong and evocative.\n- The tactile imagery in \"Between grains, time whispers\" and \"Fingers trace a map no chart can read\u2014\" effectively conveys the texture of sand.\n\nIssues:\n- **Weak Line Breaks**: Lines like \"Above, stars twinkle with memories / Faded yet still burnished by old light.\" could be strengthened. Consider breaking lines to emphasize certain words or phrases.\n- **Sentimentality**: The line \"My grasp on what once was grows thinner still\" leans towards a sentimental tone that might benefit from more concrete imagery.\n\nDirections:\n- Experiment with line breaks in the second stanza, such as splitting \"Above, stars twinkle with memories / Faded yet still burnished by old light.\" into two lines: \"Above, stars twinkle with memories / Faded, yet still burnished by old light.\"\n- Replace \"My grasp on what once was grows thinner still\" with a more concrete image. For example, consider: \"Each wave erases my name, / Leaving only whispers of the past.\"\n\nWhen these changes are implemented and the poem reads smoothly without feeling overly sentimental or lacking in vivid imagery, this poem has found its shape.",
