      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's alive\n\nThe kitchen-as-physical-container image (line 3) is the strongest instinct in the poem \u2014 \"her shoulders / fill the kitchen / the way a glass / fills with water, / then stops.\" That simile does what the brief asked: it makes absence visible through containment rather than emptiness. The shift from shoulder to glass filling with water and stopping earns its silence because it's grounded in physical observation.\n\nThe closing image \u2014 dawn bending over water \"as thin / as a knife / sliced very slowly through milk\" \u2014 has genuine strangeness. Light becoming liquid becomes metal becomes something almost violent is the kind of compression this poem needs more of.\n\nLine 24, \"bends, almost enters,\" also works because it stays in the physical and risks metaphor without fully resolving into sentiment.\n\nThe short lines are doing real work: they create a sense of hushed attention. The breath control matches the subject.\n\n### 2. What isn't working\n\n**Clich\u00e9 / dead language (line 14):** \"all of it already committed\" is the poem's weakest phrase \u2014 a paraphrase of silence-as-commitment that the brief banned. It tells what the images should have shown. Direction: cut this entirely or replace with something rooted in physical observation, as lines 23\u201325 do.\n\n**Abstraction creeping in (line 10):** \"the small geography / of pressure\" names the feeling instead of embodying it. The glass-of-water simile already *is* that embodiment. Direction: remove the explanation around the simile \u2014 let the image stand without labeling its own meaning.\n\n**Sentimentality (lines 7\u20138, 21):** \"Air escapes the seams. / Not noise \u2014 movement\" and \"No one breathes a name for it\" both flatten the poem toward easy summary. The poem is stronger when it resists naming silence directly. Direction: trust the images to carry this without editorializing.\n\n**Redundant imagery (light/dawn):** The coffee light, then thin-as-a-knife light, then dawn bending \u2014 three approximations of morning light in a short poem. One or two will do. Direction: choose the most specific and cut the others. The knife-in-milk simile is precise enough that \"dawn\" as a separate image dilutes it.\n\n**Line 26 (\"the house / is just becoming\"):** This line breaks mid-phrase to create enjambment, but the break doesn't earn its disruption \u2014 it just delays the ending. Direction: either make the line break do more tension or restructure so the final line lands with sharper force without the suspension.\n\n### 3. Revision direction\n\nThe core engine of this poem \u2014 physical containment as a substitute for speech \u2014 is sound and precise. Cut the two lines",
