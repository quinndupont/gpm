  "final_poem": "In an empty room, I am alone  \nA silent existence under your command,  \nEmptiness serenading in its infinite tunes,  \nSilence my companion as one would be with a sundial's beat. \n\nI float amidst the silence of night,   \nThe ominous whisperings echoed on by moonlight streaks,   \nIn this realm of quiet and stillness I unfold,  \nWithin these walls I enact my life\u2019s drama with silent notes. \n\nSilence is a song that lingers across the sky-line,  \nA symphony where only your subtle harmonies echo,  \nAnd in this silence you are my master and mystique divine,  \nI am but an intruder to your universe of purest stillness.\n",
