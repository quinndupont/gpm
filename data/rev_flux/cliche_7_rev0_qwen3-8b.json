  "final_poem": "A gift that time cannot erase,  \nThrough winter's chill and summer's blaze,  \nIt blooms in hearts, a silent flame,  \nA bond that outlives the name.  \n\nLike roots that grip the earth below,  \nIt grows where laughter once did flow,  \nThrough tears that fall and skies that clear,  \nA compass guiding through the year.  \n\nNo storm can sever what's been sown,  \nNo shadow dims the light it owns\u2014  \nA lifetime's tale in shared refrain,  \nA melody that echoes again.  \n\nSo here's to friends who stay the same,  \nThrough every turn, through every name,  \nA treasure forged in time's embrace\u2014  \nThe gift that lasts, the gift that stays.",
