      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe central conceit \u2014 that love outlasts everything *including* death, and the body becomes a vehicle for this fact rather than pleasure \u2014 is genuinely strong. The line \"They were conveyances\" earns its place: it does semantic work (transport vs. delivery) and physical work (vessels carrying something). That word has real force.\n\nThe closing image of the heartbeat refusing to outlive \"the sound / Of something mechanical / Finding its terms unbearable.\" That's precise, earned, and avoids the easy sentimental ending. The personification here is controlled \u2014 it doesn't say love *is* unbearable; the machine says so, which makes it more unsettling.\n\n\"Heartbeat's strange loyalty\" also works because it's specific: this isn't a generic devotion but something physically tethered to circulatory fact.\n\nThe shift from \"accumulates\" (quasi-abstract) into the calcified salt simile is well-paced \u2014 it drops the image and lets the reader carry the weight.\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Rhyme density is too high, too early.** The poem opens with a rhyme (\"name for / tallied\") that forces syntax into compression so tight it collapses. \"My body's arithmetic\" is doing something interesting *because* of its strangeness \u2014 but the following line immediately corrals it into A-B-A-B. That's the engine grinding before it should be started.\n\n**Direction:** Strip the rhyme from lines 1\u20134 entirely, or at least let one of those lines breathe with a slant rhyme or no rhyme so the opening can discover its shape without being yoked to \"name for.\" The poem is stronger after line 20. Start there.\n\n---\n\nLines 5\u20138 need attention:\n\n> I could feel you / in the tissue memory, the way heat / accumulates in skin that's forgotten / it was ever cool.\n\n**\"Tissue memory\"** is doing real work but \"accumulates in skin that's forgotten / it was ever cool\" is pure abstraction dressed as image. Skin doesn't forget \u2014 this reads like a thesis statement about entropy. The word \"cool\" appears twice in four lines, which is too much emphasis on the negation.\n\n**Direction:** Cut one instance of \"cool.\" Let heat do its own work against cold without naming it twice. Find an image that *shows* the body retaining what it shouldn't retain \u2014 a specific tactile or visual detail.\n\n---\n\nLine 13:\n\n> They were not rivers singing through me.\n\nThe negation (\"were not\") is doing too much structural work here. It's a line that exists to set up the next one, which means it's inert as its own unit.\n\n**Direction:** Make this line *do* something by giving it a concrete image or action \u2014 what do the arteries actually carry? The poem names \"warmth\" and \"a",
