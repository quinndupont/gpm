      "draft": "roots stretch deep into soil  \nseeking unseen water  \nmy child, like seedlings pushing through dirt\n\nspring rain whispers  \nsoftly urging growth above ground  \nI watch you spread your leaves towards sunbeams\n\nbuds swell, then break free  \non gentle breezes of choice and change  \nI am the earth beneath, steadfast yet silent\n\ntempests rage outside my windows  \nthunder roars like fears inside me  \nyet I remain rooted here, steady as storm clouds pass\n\nwhen leaves dance in autumn winds  \nleaving branches for winter rest  \nyou will find shelter again with roots deepened\n\nice seals lakes and cold tightens grip  \nbut life stirs within frozen earth  \nready to burst forth come thaw's first warmth",
      "critique": "What's alive:\n- The imagery of roots, seeds, and seasons effectively symbolizes growth and resilience.\n- The mother\u2019s perspective on letting go and supporting independence is clear and resonant.\n\nIssues:\n1. **Weak Line Breaks**: Lines break in a way that doesn't always enhance the natural rhythm or meaning.\n2. **Sentimentality**: There's an emotional tone that can be too direct, which might detract from the subtlety of the imagery.\n3. **Clich\u00e9 Phrases**: While you've avoided some clich\u00e9s, there are still moments where the language feels overly sentimental.\n\nDirections:\n- Strengthen line breaks to better mimic breathing or natural rhythms. For example, consider breaking lines at key moments in the action (e.g., \"buds swell, then break free\" could be two separate lines).\n- Refine the emotional tone by using more concrete and less direct language. Instead of saying \u201cI am the earth beneath,\u201d try something like \u201cgrounded under your feet.\u201d\n- Replace overly sentimental phrases with more nuanced imagery. For instance, change \u201cthunder roars like fears inside me\u201d to a more evocative description such as \u201clightning\u2019s flash mirrors sudden doubts.\u201d\n\nWhen these changes are implemented, this poem has found its shape.",
