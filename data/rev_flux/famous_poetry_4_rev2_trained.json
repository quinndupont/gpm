      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe central conceit \u2014 that the speaker has already internalized death, and therefore sleep is a habitual act rather than an exit \u2014 is genuinely strong. The poem earns its quietness through this premise: \"and nothing wakes anyone\" lands because it's preceded by concrete domestic detail (the glass of water on the nightstand *like* a station rebuilt at every block). That simile does real work, implying repetition without stating routine.\n\nThe line \"a dog lying down will suddenly know / it has been still for minutes\" is precise and earned \u2014 timing is specific enough to feel observed rather than decorated. The closing image of breath moving through the nose *like* someone reading what they've already written \u2014 that's the poem's best move: a single image doing the work of explanation without naming \"waking.\" It earns its place because it follows from the habit-structure established earlier.\n\nThe bed-as-library conceit (filing cabinet, index finger) is interesting in line 12\u201314. The dog and morning passages (lines 35\u201346) build a domestic world that justifies the dream-state the poem claims.\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Sentimentality / softening \u2014 lines 9\u201310, 27\u201328, 47\u201348:**\n\"thank you to the dark the way an old tenant says stay another month\" and \"I'm almost listening\" are where the poem reaches for feeling it hasn't built toward. The first is a simile that explains rather than enacts; the second is pure understatement doing no actual work \u2014 \"almost awake\" is sentimentality by default, not choice. **Direction:** Cut or rewrite both. The poem's habit-structure already communicates this relationship to death as tenancy. Trust the metaphor.\n\n**Abstraction / vagueness \u2014 lines 15\u201320:**\n\"There's a habit to waking. You think you're\nfalling and then aren't, which is different\nfrom being caught \u2014 more like the way\na dog lying down will suddenly know\nit has been still for minutes.\" This paragraph generalizes into sleep-awake confusion without earning its specificity through image or sensory detail. \"Falling\" is doing nothing here; it's filler. **Direction:** Either make this concrete with a single arresting moment (like the pillow crease) or cut it entirely \u2014 it doesn't advance the poem from what lines 7\u201310 already did.\n\n**Clich\u00e9 / near-clich\u00e9:**\n- \"the way someone holds a door\" (line 29) \u2014 dead metaphor\n- \"a gap, maybe, like forgetting\" (line 45) \u2014 stock phrase for loss\n- \"its quiet / appreciation\" (lines 47\u201348) \u2014 personification that weakens the closing",

      "critique": "## Revision Workshop Response\n\n---\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe closing image is the strongest moment: \"my thumb pressed into one pillow's crease, / holding it the way you'd hold / something that might say something back \u2014 / and saying nothing.\" The pillow holds. That single action carries enormous weight without explaining itself. It earns its place through physical specificity.\n\nLines 12\u201314 (\"behind the filing cabinet of 2 a.m., / where everything is indexed by its shape / and the index finger does what fingers do\") build a concrete metaphor for habituated encounter with death that justifies the dream-state the poem claims. The domestic detail \u2014 refrigerator humming through floorboards, glass on nightstand rebuilt at every block, hand open as if holding a door or breath \u2014 slowly accumulates into a world where sleep is something known rather than feared.\n\nThe dog passages (lines 35\u201346) are the poem's strongest sustained sequence: \"the dog will roll over and find the sun / that isn't there yet,\" \"blinking at the roof as if it were a country.\" The smallness of this animal perceiving absence before light arrives is precise and earns its quiet.\n\nThe radio line \"It's almost morning \u2014\" repeated between stations works because it stays inaudible, the voice kept off-air. That detail does more than any of the poem's explicit explanations.\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Sentimentality / softening (lines 9\u201310):**\n\"I said thank you to the dark the way an old tenant says \u2014 the terms are softened\" is the weakest sentence in the poem. It explains rather than enacts, and \"the terms are softened\" is pure abstraction doing no sensory work. The dog passage that follows undermines this with genuine tenderness; the human simile weakens what could be stronger.\n\n**Abstraction / vagueness (lines 15\u201320):**\n\"There's a habit to waking. You think you're\nfalling and then aren't, which is different\nfrom being caught \u2014 more like the way\na dog lying down will suddenly know\nit has been still for minutes.\" This paragraph generalizes into sleep-awake confusion without earning its specificity through image or sensory detail. \"Falling\" is doing nothing here; it's filler. Cut or replace with one concrete moment that *is* the habit.\n\n**Clich\u00e9 / near-clich\u00e9:**\n- \"the way a person holds a door \u2014 or a breath \u2014\" (line 29) \u2014 dead metaphor, two gestures collapsed into one\n- \"a gap, maybe, like forgetting\" (line 45) \u2014 stock phrase for loss\n- \"its quiet / appreciation\" (lines 47\u201348) \u2014 personification that weakens the closing\n\n**Redundancy:**\nThe poem says essentially the same thing from lines 9",
