      "critique": "**What's alive:**  \nThe opening line\u2019s physicality (\u201ctremor of bone balances on steel\u201d) and the mosaic of dust/light contrast are vivid. The shadow on the screen\u2019s \u201ccold eye\u201d and the pixelated wing create a synthetic-organic tension. The railing\u2019s groan as a \u201clow note\u201d in a \u201csymphony of unyielding things\u201d is a strong metaphor. The bird\u2019s awareness of the grid as \u201cnot its own\u201d and the feathers \u201cmapping a path through the wires\u2019 hum\u201d anchor the tension between natural and synthetic.  \n\n**Issues:**  \n- **Abstraction:** \u201chow the air here is a borrowed space\u201d is vague; it lacks the concrete contrast needed to ground the bird\u2019s experience.  \n- **Sentimentality:** \u201ccharged but unspent\u201d implies emotional buildup, which dilutes the poem\u2019s focus on physicality.  \n- **Weak line",
