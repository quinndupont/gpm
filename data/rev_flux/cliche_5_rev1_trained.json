      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe central conceit \u2014 a father who is heroic *without* being heroic, who holds together dinner instead of grand gestures \u2014 has genuine force. The onion-pressing passage (lines 3\u20136) is the poem's strongest moment: \"he let it\" earns its quiet. The egg-cracking simile that divides a field between heirs also works because it's specific and visual; it doesn't just *mean* sacrifice, it *shows* what sacrifice looks like in a kitchen.\n\nThe closing image of the child's drawing above the table \u2014 almost any poem would collapse under such weight, but here \"a dog. A dog doing somersaults\" earns its simplicity because the detail is precise and strange enough to hold attention. The son's handwriting \"My son's handwriting below said *Daddy.*\" lands with real weight partly because it's understated.\n\nThe garage door passage (lines 32\u201334) also works \u2014 the ambiguity of \"would would wouldn't\" enacts the confusion of a person who can no longer parse their own life. That line earns its difficulty.\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Sentimentality / earned vs. unearned emotion.** The poem is strongest when it resists telling the reader what to feel (the \"You're not alone\" moment, lines 31\u201334). When it *does* explain itself, that's where the emotional weight gets watered down. Direction: cut or radically compress everything from line 25 onward \u2014 \"I wanted to say something\" through the garage door passage. Let the kitchen objects do their own work without editorializing.\n\n**Clich\u00e9 / near-clich\u00e9 language.** \"Tucked in at night with a kiss and a song,\" \"saving the day,\" \"lead by example\" \u2014 these are quoted directly but they still need to be named as what they are: dead phrases. The poem's energy comes from *against* clich\u00e9, so naming where it leans on them is part of the revision.\n\n**Overextension / structural bloat.** The poem runs 36 lines and says roughly three things \u2014 that fathers hold dinner together, that a child drew \"Daddy,\" that he stood in rain with a wrench. Line 25 through line 34 adds nothing to what we already feel from the kitchen scenes. Direction: end at or before line 20, or find one final concrete image after the drawing that doesn't narrate *about* feeling.\n\n**Redundancy / \"fingers stained\" (lines 19 and 27).** The stain appears twice with different explanations \u2014 once literally, once metaphorically. One version is enough. Direction: choose which reading of the stain you want to commit to and cut the other.\n\n**Weak line breaks.** Lines break on syntactic completions almost every time (",
