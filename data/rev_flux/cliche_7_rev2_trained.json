Nothing more.\n\nBut that morning I stood at your counter\nwith a glass of water I didn't want,\nwatching you set the jar of pickles\ndown with both hands like it mattered,\n\nand I understood: someone had kept\nthe front door open all night,\nsomeone had pressed their ear\nto the wall and heard nothing wrong.\n\nThere's a kind of silence in being close\nthat isn't comfortable. It's just\nthe agreement no one names\u2014stay here.\nThe toaster clicking. The newspaper\nflat on the chair where your clothes\neventually appeared, a week, two weeks,\nfolded like someone still believed\n\nin an ending. I ate your toast.\nI let you know later. Just wanted\nyou to know I'd touched it,\n\nthat the fruit inside wasn't changed,\nthe juice still doing whatever\nit does before anyone opens anything.\n\nFriendship is not a gift I gave you.\nIt's the way we both forgot to move\nthe coffee cup on the counter,\nand neither of us picked up.

That's the part no one talks about\u2014\nhow not-speaking can hold\na room longer than any speech,\nhow being present for the small\nuneasy things is a kind of love\nthat never says *I'm here,*\nbut proves it by not leaving\nthe cap on the bottle,\n\nby standing at the sink at 3 a.m.\nmaking sure the jar stays where it was.",
      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### What's Alive\n\nThe poem has a genuine engine. The central conceit \u2014 that presence and love are proved by not leaving things alone, by letting the silence hold \u2014 is specific enough to carry weight without being generic. The kitchen at 3am is the right setting; it resists sentimentality because it stays in the physical world.\n\nThe strongest passage begins near line 15: \"watching you set the jar of pickles / down with both hands like it mattered.\" That gesture \u2014 the care in placing, the body's weight on the word *mattered* \u2014 does more emotional work than any other line. The phrase \"someone had kept / the front door open all night\" also lands hard because it's concrete and strange enough.\n\nThe final two lines (\"by standing at the sink at 3 a.m. / making sure the jar stays where it was\") close the poem with earned quiet. That ending earns its silence.\n\n### What Isn't Working\n\n**Redundancy / Structural Collapse (lines 19\u201326):**\nStarting roughly at \"I understood,\" the poem's emotional intelligence suddenly accelerates and then circles back too much. The passage from lines 17 through 24 is three iterations of similar silence with very little progression between them. Each time \"silence\" or \"nothing wrong\" appears, it re-states rather than deepens.\n\n**Direction:** Cut at least one full iteration \u2014 either the morning counter scene entirely or the newspaper/folded clothes sequence. Let repetition build; right now each return flattens what the previous version intensified.\n\n**Clich\u00e9 / Dead Language (lines 3\u20135):**\n\"Time can't break us apart,\" \"I'll be there for you no matter what,\" and \"a true friend is like a sibling\" \u2014 these were already flagged in the brief, but they still need to go. The toast crumbling with the phone sliding across the table is far more alive than any of those dead phrases.\n\n**Direction:** Replace them with sensory material that matches the quality of the kitchen at 3am and the pickles being set down \"with both hands.\" The poem's best language lives in physical specificity \u2014 write toward that standard everywhere.\n\n**Sentimentality (lines 10\u201312):**\n\"Nothing more\" after cataloguing three concrete gestures is the poem telling the reader what to feel rather than letting the images do it. It deflates.\n\n**Direction:** Cut \"nothing more.\" Let the faucet, the cough, and the speaker louder stand as three independent details \u2014 no summarizing after them.\n\n**Weak Line Breaks (line 13):**\n\"you coughed once. Nothing more.\" The line break on \"more\" doesn't create productive tension; it just ends a sentence early. A stronger break would use enjambment to pull the reader forward into what follows, or place a word that *enacts* the empt",

      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### What's Alive\n\nThe kitchen at 3am is the right engine. \"The phone sliding across the kitchen table / where I'd left my toast mid-crumble\" \u2014 that detail earns its place because it's specific, physical, and sets up a whole morning without explaining itself. The line about the jar of pickles being set down with both hands like it mattered is the poem's strongest single image: care in the gesture, weight on the word *mattered*, no commentary from either speaker.\n\nThe closing \u2014 \"making sure the jar stays where it was\" \u2014 lands because it has earned its quiet through concrete action. The repetition of small gestures (the counter, the sink) builds without collapsing.\n\n### What Isn't Working\n\n**Redundancy and Clich\u00e9 (lines 17\u201326):**\nThe passage from \"But that morning I stood at your counter\" to \"folded like someone still believed / in an ending\" is three iterations of similar silence with very little progression. The poem says *silence matters* three times but doesn't deepen or complicate the meaning each time it returns.\n\n**Direction:** Cut one full iteration \u2014 either the morning counter scene entirely or the newspaper/folded clothes sequence. Let repetition build; right now each return flattens what the previous version intensified.\n\n**Sentimentality / Abstraction (lines 10\u201312):**\n\"Nothing more.\" After cataloguing three concrete gestures, the poem tells us \"nothing more\" \u2014 which is the poet summarizing for the reader rather than letting the images do their work. The line deflates after a moment of genuine pressure.\n\n**Direction:** Cut \"nothing more.\" Let the faucet, the cough, and the speaker louder stand as three independent details; no summarizing after them.\n\n**Weak Line Break (line 13):**\n\"You coughed once. Nothing more.\" The line break on \"more\" doesn't create productive tension \u2014 it just ends a sentence early. A stronger enjambment would pull the reader forward into what follows, or place a word that *enacts* the emptiness.\n\n**Direction:** Break after \"coughed\" and let \"nothing more\" sit as its own line with some pressure in it; reposition so silence is enacted rather than named.\n\n**Clich\u00e9 (line 16):**\n\"There's a kind of silence in being close \u2014 / not comfortable, just / the agreement no one names\" is the poem explaining itself. The morning counter and pickles already proved this.\n\n**Direction:** Cut entirely. Trust the images; they're doing the philosophical work without announcing it.\n\n**Weak Line Break (line 27):**\n\"That's the part no one talks about\u2014\" breaks on a weak syntactic unit. \"About\" is hanging.\n\n**Direction:** Re-break to land on a stronger word \u2014 \"speech,\" for example: \"how not-speaking can hold",
