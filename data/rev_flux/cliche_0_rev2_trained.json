The woman behind the counter said\n*see? It's already stamped* \u2014 and she was right.\n\nNow I can't find your comb. It must be somewhere\nin the top drawer of the one you refused to call a closet,\nthe one with the wooden spoon still holding together\nthanks to the duct tape I kept in the bathroom.\n\nAt three o'clock on Tuesday, there is a shadow\non the hallway floor that looks like nothing \u2014 a crease,\na fold, a thing pressed flat against the linoleum\nwhile someone slept. It was not always here.\n\nYou stopped wearing gloves at thirty-two.\nI remember because I opened the garage door\nand the cold hit both of our hands at once,\nand you stood there with your jacket off,\nyour nails slightly longer on the side\nwhere you'd been peeling fruit in the kitchen.\n\nNo one would write down what you left behind.\nNo one would look twice at the dent\nin the couch cushion from where you sat\nevery Sunday without knowing why.\n\nI found a crumpled letter addressed to *my wife*\non the radiator in August. It said *you're right,*\nand I could tell because the signature was smaller\nthan yours had been six months earlier,\nwhich means someone measured this.\nWhich means no one won.\n\nThe morning after Thanksgiving you stood at the window\nwatching a cardinal hit the glass \u2014 both of you,\nthe bird and the light it left behind on the pane,\nand you said *that's my favorite thing*\nin a voice so soft I knew you were talking\nto someone else in the room already.\n\nI never stopped seeing you as the child who\nsat on the counter with the package of vitamins\nasking if I was scared. You didn't wait for an answer.\n\nThe kitchen still has your glasses on the hook.\nThe water is always running in that one faucet.\nAnd every evening at six-thirteen, when the yardlight\ncomes on across the street and you step outside,\nI turn without looking because I know\nyou'll be there \u2014 standing in the way of nothing,\nholding what matters.\n\nWhat gets left out: any mention of love as a noun,\nany anniversary card, any moment where I name what we do.\nThe poem is built from what stays. Everything else\nwas never in doubt to begin with.",

It's specific, it's transactional, and it carries enormous emotional weight without announcing itself. The detail of the counterwoman's stamp is more alive than any declaration about love could be.\n\nThe crumpled letter on the radiator in August \u2014 \"it said *you're right,*\" / \"the signature was smaller\" \u2014 that sequence does real work: it shows someone watching another person watch a third person, and the nesting of attention becomes the whole poem. The detail earns its weight because it's not explained.\n\nThe cardinal hitting glass moment \u2014 \"both of you, / the bird and the light it left behind on the pane\" \u2014 lands because it stays in the physical world rather than floating into sentimentality. The speaker's line (\"that's my favorite thing\") arriving as a quote from inside the scene is a strong structural choice; it distances the speaker without losing intimacy.\n\nThe closing image of standing at six-thirteen, \"holding what matters\" \u2014 that's plain and quiet enough to work. It trusts the accumulated detail around it.\n\n### What Isn't Working\n\n**Sentimentality / editorializing (lines 39\u201342):**\n\"What gets left out: any mention of love as a noun, / any anniversary card, any moment where I name what we do.\" This is the poem explaining itself. The brief was right to forbid abstraction \u2014 \"true love lasting forever is rare\" \u2014 but the closing still does that very thing by listing things *not* in the poem. **Direction:** Cut this entirely or replace it with one more concrete image from the domestic landscape. The poem doesn't need to name what it's about; it already shows it.\n\n**Clich\u00e9 (line 27):**\n\"the cold hit both of our hands at once\" \u2014 this is a dead metaphor, the hands-as-one-thing clich\u00e9. It deflates after the specificity of the garage door opening and the jacket being off. **Direction:** Make the body detail as particular as \"the comb in the drawer.\"\n\n**Repetition without escalation (lines 15\u201320):**\nThe three domestic scenes \u2014 comb, drawer, shadow at three o'clock \u2014 are close enough to feel like a list rather than a progression. The shadow is the weakest because it's pure abstraction (\"a crease, / a fold\") and doesn't land with the same authority as the quarter or the letter. **Direction:** Rank these by emotional weight and cut one. The poem can't have three domestic observations at this intensity; one must be the strongest image in the piece.\n\n**Tonal inconsistency (lines 27\u201334):**\nThe shift from \"I\" to \"you stopped wearing gloves\" then back to \"I\" loses coherence \u2014 who is speaking?
