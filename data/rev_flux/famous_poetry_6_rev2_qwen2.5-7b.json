      "draft": "In cyberspace's hum, old tunes blend,\nWhispers through wires where folk beats send.\nKeyboards click like plucks on strings new,\nElectric melodies echo in blue.\n\nVoice modulated to fit virtual dreams,\nRhythms sync with screens and code streams.\nChains of iron, chains of glowing screens\u2014\nSongs adapt, but the spirit doesn't wane here.\n\nBasslines hum where once hoe met soil,\nEchoes dance as data moves on a roll.\nYet in this grid, beneath AI's breath,\nStories echo\u2014of labor, earth, and death.\n\nVirtual worlds where sweat still drips,\nIn circuits and servers, through screens and wires.\nA symphony of struggle, of hope, of might\u2014\nSinging through lines that bind us right.",
      "critique": "What's alive:\n- The imagery of blending traditional folk tunes with digital sounds is intriguing and sets a vivid scene.\n- The lines \"Basslines hum where once hoe met soil\" and \"Echoes dance as data moves on a roll\" create a powerful contrast that highlights the transition from physical labor to virtual work.\n\nIssues:\n1. **Weak Line Breaks**: Lines like \"In cyberspace's hum, old tunes blend,\" and \"Keyboards click like plucks on strings new,\" could benefit from more strategic breaks to enhance rhythm and flow.\n2. **Clich\u00e9 Phrases**: The phrase \"spirit doesn't wane here\" is a clich\u00e9 that detracts from the freshness of the poem.\n3. **Overly Abstract Terms**: Words like \"grid\" and \"AI's breath\" can be more evocative if grounded in specific, sensory details.\n\nDirections:\n1. Revise line breaks to create a more rhythmic flow. For example, consider breaking \"In cyberspace's hum, old tunes blend,\" into two lines: \"In cyberspace\u2019s hum / Old tunes blend.\"\n2. Replace clich\u00e9 phrases like \"spirit doesn't wane here\" with something more original and specific. Perhaps something like \"the soul of labor endures.\"\n3. Ground abstract terms in sensory details. For instance, replace \"grid\" with \"digital lattice,\" and describe the AI's breath as a \"whispered pulse.\"\n\nWhen done:\nThis poem has found its shape.",
