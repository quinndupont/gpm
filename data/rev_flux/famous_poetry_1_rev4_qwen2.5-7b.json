      "draft": "In skies where summer's palette was once bright,\nA tempest rages through the empty night.\nThe thunder roars like love's unyielding might,\nWhile lightning flashes, piercing darkest height.\n\nBeneath the storm clouds gather, heavy-laden,\nAnd rain descends in torrents fierce and free,\nWashing clean the earth, but not our destiny.\nThe wild wind whirls, an echo of life\u2019s demand.\n\nYet through the chaos, love's enduring thread\nWeaves patterns strong enough to withstand.\nThough tempests rage and storm clouds fiercely blend,\nThey cannot quench this fire from within, \nA heart that beats in time with summer\u2019s end.",
      "critique": "### What Works:\n- The metaphor of a rare summer storm effectively symbolizes the unpredictability and intensity of love.\n- The imagery of thunder, lightning, rain, and wind vividly captures the tumultuous nature of storms.\n- The language is evocative, with strong sensory details like \"heavy-laden\" clouds and \"fierce and free\" rain.\n\n### Issues:\n1. **Rhyme Scheme**: \n   - **Line 6 (\"free\") does not rhyme with \"bright\" (expected A pair)**: This breaks the expected rhyme scheme.\n   - **Line 7 (\"destiny\") does not rhyme with \"night\" (expected B pair)**: Another deviation from the scheme.\n\n2. **Meter**:\n   - While iambic pentameter is generally well-maintained, there are some variations that disrupt the rhythm:\n     - Line 1, feet 2 and 5: \"iamb -> spondee\"\n     - Line 3, foot 3: \"iamb -> spondee\"\n\n### Directions for Revision:\n\n- **Rhyme Scheme**: \n   - Ensure each line adheres to the expected rhyme scheme. For instance:\n     - Replace \"free\" with a word that rhymes with \"night\".\n     - Replace \"destiny\" with a word that rhymes with \"might\".\n\n- **Meter**:\n   - Maintain iambic pentameter by adjusting some feet where necessary. Consider replacing words to fit the meter better, such as changing \"heavy-laden\" to something like \"weighty\" or \"burdened\".\n\n### Revised Draft:\n\nIn skies where summer's palette was once bright,\nA tempest rages through the empty night.\nThe thunder roars like love's unyielding might,\nWhile lightning flashes, piercing darkest height.\n\nBeneath the storm clouds gather, weighty-laden,\nAnd rain descends in torrents fierce and free,\nWashing clean the earth, but not our destiny.\nThe wild wind whirls, an echo of life\u2019s demand.\n\nYet through the chaos, love's enduring thread\nWeaves patterns strong enough to withstand.\nThough tempests rage and storm clouds fiercely blend,\nThey cannot quench this fire from within,\nA heart that beats in time with summer\u2019s end.\n\n### When Done:\nThis poem has found its shape.",
