      "draft": "In the quiet hum of morning light,\nhis hand on mine as we walk out, \nonto the back porch where tomatoes cling\nto their green tendrils like shy fingers.\nHe points to a leaf that splits in two\u2014\na crack from last night\u2019s wind or something more?\n\u201cYou see,\u201d he says softly, \u201ceven growth needs\nstrength and resilience. And a bit of care.\u201d\n\nIn his kitchen, flour dusts the air \nlike spring snow, while on a board,\nan array of fresh apples stands.\nHe slices one, letting its juice\nfall into a bowl like sunlight\u2019s first rays.\nEach cut a lesson in patience\u2014\nnot to rush the ripening or force it along.\n\nOutside, the backyard whispers secrets:\na tree with wide branches sheltering \nflowers that bend but don\u2019t break. \nTogether we plant seeds, watching them push through,\nroots finding their way, reaching for life\u2019s warmth.\nIn these small acts of tending and teaching,\nhis wisdom blooms, a silent kindling\nof light, guiding not by words or deeds grandiose,\nbut in the everyday, unspoken care that nurtures.",
      "critique": "What's alive:\n- The sensory details of nature and the home environment effectively symbolize growth, stability, and nurturing.\n- The quiet moments shared between father and son are poignantly captured, emphasizing subtle acts of heroism.\n\nIssues:\n1. **Weak Line Breaks**: Some lines feel too long or could benefit from more strategic breaks to enhance rhythm and emphasis.\n2. **Sentimentality**: There is a tendency towards sentimentality in the descriptions of the father's actions, which can make them seem overly emotional rather than natural.\n3. **Overuse of Metaphors**: The repeated use of metaphors (e.g., \"crack from last night\u2019s wind or something more,\" \"juice falling into a bowl like sunlight\u2019s first rays\") can become clich\u00e9-like and may detract from the originality.\n\nDirections:\n- Revise line breaks to create natural pauses that reflect the rhythm of everyday actions. For example, break lines where there are shifts in thought or sensory detail.\n- Refine the language to avoid sentimentality by focusing on concrete observations rather than emotional overtones. For instance, instead of \"a crack from last night\u2019s wind or something more?\" consider a simpler observation like \"a scar from last night's storm.\"\n- Reduce the number of metaphors and replace them with more direct descriptions. For example, change \"juice falling into a bowl like sunlight\u2019s first rays\" to \"juice dripping into a bowl.\"\n\nWhen done:\nThis poem has found its shape.",
