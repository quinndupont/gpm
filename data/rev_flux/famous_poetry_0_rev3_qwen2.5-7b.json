      "draft": "Amidst whispers of ancient pines,\nBark rough under his calloused palm.\nLeaf shadows dance in dappled light,\nA rustle, a sigh from bough to ground.\n\nRoots grip tight where soft earth meets cold stone\u2014\nThe traveler pausing, heart a drum.\nSapling leaves barely rustle above;\nAir carries the scent of wet moss and decay.\n\nEach step shatters silence into pebbles,\nCrackling underfoot in brittle protest.\nA hissing brook darts by, cool against gravel,\nIts song a lonely echo of what once was shared.\n\nBetween gnarled trunks, shadows play tricks,\nLong fingers reaching for unseen hands.\nFerns unfurl their fronds like whispered secrets\u2014\nGossipy whispers that dare to speak too soon.\n\nSunlight pierces canopy in jagged patches,\nTearing veils from the traveler's eyes.\nHe pauses, breath catching at the sight:\nA fox\u2019s tail flickering through underbrush.\n\nThe air hums with life that thrives unseen,\nBreathes between leaves and rocks, beneath earth\u2019s skin.\nEach choice a whisper among echoes\u2014\nHow to tread in such quietness, where every step counts?\n\nRooted still, he seeks not paths but presence,\nIn the hush of green, the rustle, the hum.",
      "critique": "What's alive:\n- The sensory details of the forest, particularly in lines like \"Bark rough under his calloused palm\" and \"A hissing brook darts by, cool against gravel.\"\n- The traveler\u2019s internal conflict is palpable through phrases such as \"The traveler pausing, heart a drum\" and \"Each choice a whisper among echoes.\"\n\nWhat isn't working:\n1. **Weak Line Breaks**: Lines like \"Roots grip tight where soft earth meets cold stone\u2014The traveler pausing, heart a drum.\" could be more effective if broken differently to reflect the traveler's pause.\n2. **Overuse of Abstract Phrases**: The phrase \"A hissing brook darts by, cool against gravel\" is quite vivid but the line \"Each choice a whisper among echoes\u2014\" leans towards abstraction and can feel clich\u00e9 in this context.\n\nDirection:\n- Consider breaking lines to emphasize pauses and hesitations. For example, change \"Roots grip tight where soft earth meets cold stone\u2014The traveler pausing, heart a drum.\" to \"Roots grip tight, where soft earth meets cold stone. The traveler pauses, heart a drum.\"\n- Replace abstract phrases with more concrete imagery. Instead of \"Each choice a whisper among echoes,\" try something like \"Each step a silent question, in the hush of green.\"\n\nWhen done:\nThis poem has found its shape.",
