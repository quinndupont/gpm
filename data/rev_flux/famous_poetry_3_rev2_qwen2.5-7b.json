      "draft": "In the grip of dawn's first chill,\na heavy cloak whispers across the hill.\nFingers trace its soft, unyielding breath\u2014\nleaves like old hands, offering no warmth.\n\nEyes wander where shadows dance and weave,\nbetween branches that bend with careless grace.\nEvery step a sigh, a load too light to bear,\nas the world shifts, inviting, then withdrawing.\n\nA weight pulls from within\u2014a duty worn,\nlike ancient leather, tight but never broken.\nIt calls out not in silence's hush or song,\nbut in the quiet ache of promises strong.\n\nThe woods press close, an embrace cold and deep,\nand yet\u2014what draws closer than that which chills?\nSoftness against the skin, a silent plea\nto linger here with roots as if they were knees.",
      "critique": "What's Alive:\n- The tactile imagery of \"a heavy cloak whispers across the hill\" and \"leaves like old hands, offering no warmth\" effectively conveys the cold and unyielding nature.\n- The internal conflict between duty and nature\u2019s allure is well explored through phrases like \"A weight pulls from within\u2014a duty worn\" and \"what draws closer than that which chills?\"\n\nWhat Isn't Working:\n1. **Weak Line Breaks**: Some lines feel too long, disrupting the flow and rhythm of the poem.\n   - Example: \"Every step a sigh, a load too light to bear, as the world shifts, inviting, then withdrawing.\"\n   - Direction: Consider breaking this line into two or three shorter lines to create a pause that mirrors the hesitation in the speaker's journey.\n\n2. **Sentimentality**: The poem leans towards sentimentality with phrases like \"softness against the skin\" and \"a silent plea,\" which can make it feel overly emotional.\n   - Direction: Try to balance the emotional weight by grounding the lines more in physical sensations, such as \"The woods press close, an embrace cold and deep.\"\n\n3. **Overuse of \"soft\"**: The word \"soft\" is used multiple times, which might dilute its impact.\n   - Direction: Replace or vary synonyms for \"soft,\" like using \"gentle\" or \"tender,\" to maintain the poem's texture without repetition.\n\n4. **Clich\u00e9 Phrases**: While you've avoided some common clich\u00e9s, phrases like \"promises bind us to the world\" and \"what draws closer than that which chills?\" could be more original.\n   - Direction: Refine these lines for freshness, perhaps by rephrasing them or finding a new way to express the idea.\n\nWhen done:\nThis poem has found its shape.",
