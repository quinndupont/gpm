  "final_poem": "Beneath the ash of twilight's sigh,  \ntwo paths diverged in a yellow wood\u2014  \none, a trail of weathered stone,  \nthe other, a whisper of moss and mud.  \n\nI chose the latter, where shadows stretch,  \nand the wind hummed a tune of the unknown.  \nEach step etched a question in the earth,  \na map of the unspoken, the undone.  \n\nThe first road led to a mirrored sky,  \nwhere choices were numbered, and time stood still.  \nBut the second, wild and unbound,  \nwove through the dark with a thief\u2019s thrill.  \n\nNow, when I trace the scars of the path,  \nI see how the world bent to fit my stride\u2014  \nnot a road less traveled, but a road  \nthat learned to bend, and the bend made me wide.",
