      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe poem has real momentum in its second half, where the repetition of \"knock\" earns its place and the final three lines land with genuine weight:\n\n> Silence is the bass / the subatomic frequency / that keeps the house together / and doesn't know it\n\nThat closing line does what the angle asked \u2014 it reframes silence as something active, unconscious. The phrase \"doesn't know it\" gives the poem a surprising intellectual turn without losing its sensory grounding.\n\nThe image of gums holding water (line 20) is specific enough to feel like discovery rather than decoration.\n\nThe shift from breath and skin in the first half toward interior anatomy (veins as guitar strings, knocking) broadens the poem's domain without abandoning it. That's good structural instinct.\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Clich\u00e9 proximity / near-misses:**\n- \"Walls exhale\" \u2014 this is a trope of atmosphere, not sensation. It tells rather than shows what stillness does to surfaces.\n- \"a hum beneath the skin\" \u2014 \"hum\" appears twice (lines 3 and 16), and both times it's vague enough that the poem defaults on something more precise. What kind of hum? Blood? Muscle tissue?\n- \"learning to dry\" \u2014 this simile for breath condensing on glass is too easy. It explains what happens instead of letting the image do its own work.\n- \"Without sound the blood / forgets its name\" \u2014 \"forgets its name\" is an abstraction dressed in physical language. What does it actually *do*? The line needs to show that blood becomes more liquid, more active, or more still \u2014 not that it loses a label.\n\n**Repetition direction:**\nThe repetition of \"knock\" works because the syntax isolates each instance (line 23). Use this model elsewhere. Repetition should always shift meaning slightly with each recurrence; right now many repetitions in the first half circle back to the same flat note.\n\n**Line breaks / form:**\nLines like \"the air I forgot\" and \"each vein a guitar string\" lean on inverted syntax for effect without earning it \u2014 they read as corrections, not choices. Direction: trust the line break to create tension; let natural phrasing do the inverting.\n\"Without sound the blood / forgets its name\" \u2014 that enjambment doesn't pull hard enough.\n\n**Direction summary:** Cut or rewrite any line where a clich\u00e9 is reaching for the word and the poem couldn't find one on its own. The stillness angle is strong; the next draft should narrow imagery further and let repetition do more structural work.",

      "critique": "## Revision Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe final stretch from \"I count my sternum's / three knocks\" through the closing line is where the poem finds its shape. The repetition of \"knock, knock, / that third one dropped once and stayed dropped\" works because each recitation shifts slightly \u2014 the first two are rhythmic, then the silence arrives as a physical event, not a statement. That's the angle's core idea (silence is something *done*, not named) executed with real craft.\n\nThe guitar string simile for veins (\"tuned to the subnote of what keeps us from standing up\") has genuine compression \u2014 it earns its abstraction by anchoring it in the body rather than floating above it. The ocean fogging a windowpane image (line 17) is specific, visual, and doesn't explain itself.\n\nThe structural logic \u2014 moving from skin to breath to blood to bone to house \u2014 builds a chain of stillness that justifies its own expansion at the close (\"the house shakes when finally\").\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**\"Not sound exactly, / more like the hum a guitar string holds / below the note.\"**\n\nThis is where the poem's attention splits between two things: breath-as-vibration and blood-as-string. Keep one. The passage currently reads as catalog rather than sequence.\n\n**\"the medullary rays, / the ray cell walls stacked like arguments / carefully stacked in a library no one vows to use.\"**\n\n\"Vows to use\" is ornamental abstraction. \"Stacked in a library no one vows to use\" is more interesting \u2014 cut or find language that keeps the architectural metaphor grounded without personifying neglect.\n\n**\"Pressing where collarbone meets skull, a constant / buzz \u2014 not pain but the frequency that bears / the house together: beam timber, joist,\"**\n\nThe shift from \"buzz\" (repetition already done) to \"beam timber, joist\" is catalog again. The poem's best move here is pure sound (\"the sub-Subway of the vertebrae\") \u2014 find more sonic invention.\n\n**\"I watch my breath fog a window pane / and see there how a small ocean\"**\n\nThe \"and see there\" construction is explanatory, not poetic. Cut it or replace with an image that doesn't narrate its own metaphor-making.\n\n**Direction:**\n\n- **Cut the catalog passages (lines 7\u201310, lines 23\u201325).** The poem's strength is its compression \u2014 each line should do one thing and do it well enough to stand alone. If a line needs \"not sound exactly\" or \"more like,\" that means the preceding image wasn't precise.\n\n- **Trust repetition more.** Let \"knock, knock\" shift meaning with each recurrence as it does at the close. Use that mechanism throughout \u2014 \"fogged the pane\" doesn't need",
