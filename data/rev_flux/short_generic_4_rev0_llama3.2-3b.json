  "final_poem": "Fragile threads of forgotten time\nUnravel in the whispers of the mind\nEchoes of laughter, tears, and sighs\nWhispers that refuse to demise\n\nIn dusty corners of the heart\nMemories slumber, never apart\nFrom moments long since lost to sight\nWhere shadows still hold on to light\n\nLike autumn leaves, they fall away\nAs seasons pass with fleeting day\nAnd though the mind tries to recall\nThe memories remain standing tall",
