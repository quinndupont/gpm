Consider breaking lines where natural pauses occur.\n  - For instance, break the line at \"gold\" (line 5) or \"cores\" (line 10).\n\n- **Refine Line Breaks:**\n  - Use line breaks to emphasize key phrases and create a more fluid reading experience.\n\n- **Reduce Sentimentality:**\n  - Avoid overly emotional language.
