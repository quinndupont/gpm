      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe poem has a real engine in its final seven lines, where the hands do the work without naming emotion:\n\n> *his thumb against the crease / of wrist \u2014 held too hard*\n>\n> *the coffee cup in her hand / pale finger grips the edge*\n>\n> *he could reach out and / touch the chair leg*\n>\n> *instead the glass stays / where it was placed*\n\nThe dashes create a physical rhythm, each one stopping mid-thought. \"Held too hard\" \u2014 that's the body betraying before consciousness catches up. The glass staying where it was placed is devastating because it's so ordinary: no one picked it up.\n\n> *her nails drawn into the palm / of whoever might ask*\n\nThat line earns its complexity \u2014 it's self-comfort, vulnerability disguised as habit. It doesn't announce itself.\n\nThe fern dropping a frond in line 21 is the poem's best image outside the hands; it grounds everything in actual physical observation rather than emotional summary.\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Abstraction and editorializing (lines 9\u201313):**\n> *not looking at each other / the way the room arranges itself*\n>\n> *something in the hum / decides*\n\n\"Arranges itself,\" \"decides\" \u2014 these are the poem explaining what it just showed. The first line is almost a title tag, which undermines trust. Cut or replace entirely: let the fern and the hands do the metaphysical work.\n\n**Direction:** The room should remain crowded with objects *and* specific enough that the reader sees this particular space. \"A coat on the hook\" works \u2014 name more coats, more hooks, what's behind them.\n\n**Weak line break (line 14):**\n> *neither moving toward / the space between them*\n\nThis is the poem losing control. The dash in lines above it earns its place; this one just splits a clause. Re-break or cut entirely \u2014 the line doesn't gain anything by breaking there that it wouldn't get by ending on \"them.\"\n\n**Clich\u00e9 residue (line 15):**\n> *a fern dropping a frond*\n\nA fern doing something is still an image, but it's generic nature-writing. If this stays, make it stranger or more particular \u2014 what kind of fern? What does the frond look like?\n\n**Direction:** The poem's best move is to stay inside the hands and objects. Trust those more than the ambient commentary.\n\n### 3. Form Guidance\n\nThe dash-as-pause technique (lines 7, 10, 14) works when it's isolated \u2014 not stacked three in a row, which risks becoming a crutch. Consider using one per stanza maximum, or replace two with stronger line breaks that create tension without a mark.\n\nThis poem has found its shape.",
