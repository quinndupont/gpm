The closing dog barking at an empty yard (lines 40\u201344) also lands: exterior perception, no explanation needed.\n\n\"Each floorboard pressed into its own remembered welcome\" has real sonic and physical truth; the verb \"pressed\" does double duty \u2014 it's weighty in both sense and feeling. The orange peels suspended inside their peeling (line 1) is a small but arresting image that earns attention.\n\n---\n\n### 2.

The sheet metaphor above it was already doing something \u2014 now this line tries to *explain* what that meant. Cut or replace with a single concrete image: what does the sheet actually look like? What sound does it make?\n\n**Clich\u00e9 / Dead Language (lines 27\u201330).**\n> The nightstand took fifty candles,\n> tended even after they went out,\n> their wax stiffening into small\n> memorials under the pillowcase no one changed.\n\n\"Tended,\" \"memorials,\" \"no one changed\" \u2014 this reads like a greeting card version of the candle image. \"Tended\" does nothing; it's a verb that signals emotion without earning it.

      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n---\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe bird nest in the cabinet (lines 23\u201325) is the poem's strongest moment \u2014 a single precise detail that does more emotional work than any other passage. The closing dog barking at an empty yard (lines 40\u201344) also lands: exterior perception, no explanation needed.\n\n\"Each floorboard pressed into its own remembered welcome\u2014 / the switch for every light doing its work / without being touched.\" This is genuine domestic observation. \"Pressed into its own remembered welcome\" has real sonic and physical truth; the verb \"pressed\" does double duty \u2014 it's weighty in both sense and feeling.\n\nThe orange peels suspended inside their peeling (line 1) is a small but arresting image that earns attention.\n\n---\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Redundancy / Over-explanation (lines 35\u201340).**\n> I opened once to put something in\n> and found my hand had memorized\n> the way a socket fits a spoon.\n> Each thing still knows what it was supposed to hold\u2014\n> that weight lives somewhere past forgetting,\n> in how a drawer closes on its own, in glass\n> that doesn't ask to be looked at.\n\nThis is the poem explaining itself *twice*. The first three lines are the image. The next seven lines are the thesis. Cut or compress everything after \"memorized.\" Let the action speak for what it means.\n\n**Sentimentality / Abstraction (lines 31\u201332).**\n> Now the sheets pull taut across the mattress\u2014\n> a hymn left open on its stand:\n> no rehearsing, no choir,\n> just the black music holding.\n\n\"Black music holding\" is decorative. The sheet metaphor above it was already doing something \u2014 now this line tries to *explain* what that meant. Cut or replace with a single concrete image: what does the sheet actually look like? What sound does it make?\n\n**Clich\u00e9 / Dead Language (lines 27\u201330).**\n> Their wax stiffening into small\n> memorials under the pillowcase no one changed.\n\n\"Tendered,\" \"memorials,\" \"no one changed\" \u2014 this reads like a greeting card version of the candle image. Direction: replace with what the candles actually did when left unattended.\n\n**Catalog / Furniture List (lines 15\u201324).**\n> The chair at the gate\u2014\n> the wood would hold my weight like a confession,\n> how much or how little I had carried on.\n>\n> Instead I filled the second bedroom\n> with every jar of jam, each label pressed shut against the next.\n\nThe catalog risks becoming a list of things to check off. Direction: choose two or three domestic objects and develop them; cut the rest. The poem is stronger when it narrows rather",

  "final_poem": "# The House I Never Lived In\n\nThere was a kitchen with three oranges,\npeels curled inside their peeling\nand a faucet that dropped one bright\nsilver coin every fifteen seconds\u2014\nlike something time had unlearned to stop.\n\nI watched a cardinal build its small\nempire above the stove: bent twig, bright feather dust.\nEach piece fitted so precisely I kept my mouth\nclosed for weeks, afraid the house\nwould answer back with architecture.\n\nThe bird's nest sat in the cabinet,\none blue chip of ceramic holding together what remained\u2014\nI could have put it right. Instead I stood\nin the hallway where each floorboard pressed its own welcome,\nthe switch doing its work without my touch.\n\nThere was a chair left turned\nslightly open at the gate\u2014\nthe wood would hold my weight like a confession,\nhow much or how little I had carried on.\n\nI filled the second bedroom\nwith every jar of jam: each label pressed shut against the next.\nA wax ring hardened in one mug, its circular memory\nof whatever had been said while leaning down to drink.\n\nThe dog barks where the yard ends:\na line he doesn't cross but keeps pressing\u2014\nI think he's not barking for me,\nhe's barking for that sound a border makes\nbefore it stops being a boundary and is just\nthe quiet this house lets happen, close to bone.\n\nThe cabinet holds its nest like a language the body remembers:\nI could go back. I could not.\nBut the house carries every meal offered,\nevery door left slightly open\u2014\nwith the throat still holding its shape,\nstill speaking what was said.",
