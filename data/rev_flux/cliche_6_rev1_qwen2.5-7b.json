      "draft": "In the quiet hum of the city,\nWhere shadows whisper and light flees early,\nTheir eyes, two wells where dreams lie,\nTold tales without a word's reply.\n\nSoftly spoken winds through eaves,\nCarried secrets in their leaves\u2014\nWhispers of pasts untold,\nEchoes from lands cold.\n\nFingers traced lines invisible,\nDrawing maps not on paper but skin.\nA touch so light it almost didn't exist,\nBut left its mark in silent insistence.\n\nAnd in those glances, a language pure,\nWhere words are merely dust, no more endure.\nLaughter like chimes through open air\u2014\nAn offering to the rarest of fare.\n\nYet in that gaze, deeper still,\nA river flows beneath it all\u2014\nCrimson currents, tides unseen,\nThat cradle thoughts as deep-seen.",
      "critique": "What's Alive:\n- The imagery of \"whispers in shadows\" and \"secrets carried by leaves\" creates a mysterious, almost ethereal atmosphere.\n- The metaphor of \"fingers traced lines invisible / Drawing maps not on paper but skin\" effectively conveys the intangible nature of connection.\n\nIssues (Type, Location, Direction):\n1. **Abstraction**: Lines 3-4 are somewhat abstract and could benefit from more concrete imagery or a clearer emotional journey.\n   - Consider specifying what kind of \"tales\" these eyes tell without words. Are they stories of love, loss, or something else?\n2. **Weak Line Breaks**: The line breaks in lines 10-13 can be adjusted to enhance the flow and emphasize certain elements.\n   - Try breaking up the long sentence into smaller chunks: \"A touch so light / it almost didn't exist, / but left its mark / in silent insistence.\"\n3. **Sentimentality**: Lines 14-15 are a bit overly romantic and could be more subtle to maintain the emotional depth without becoming clich\u00e9.\n   - Consider replacing \"offering to the rarest of fare\" with something more understated: \"A moment's touch, / a fleeting embrace.\"\n4. **Clich\u00e9s**: The phrase \"a language pure\" in line 16 is close to a cliche and might be too direct.\n   - Try rephrasing it to something like: \"A silent tongue, / where whispers are heard.\"\n\nWhen done:\nThis poem has found its shape.",
