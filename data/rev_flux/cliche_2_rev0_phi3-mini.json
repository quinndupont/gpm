  "final_poem": "In unison, our souls intertwine and merge  \nWith a rhythm that whispers like an ancient pledge; two hearts within one hearth.   \nNot in competition but complemented by love\u2019 endless surge,    \nA symphony of affection we continuously wedge. \nMirroring each other as the moon mimics earth's glow  \nIn this cosmic dance where only understanding knows; an intertwined tableau below and above.   \nEternal love that defies space-time, beyond our mortal coil\u2019s cage    \nBurnished bright in a timeless age - the echoes of passion engrave on life's page:  \nA union founded upon trust with no boundary or wall;  an oath to each other we never brag.   \nIn every heartbeat, our story is told and re-told    \nThrough whispers in darkness where love grows cold - yet here within us forever enrobed:  \nFor you are my world without end's mould; a bond unbroken by time or fights.   \nOur hearts beat as one, not with fear of losing the tune but instead find solace and grace in our shared delightful plight\u2014our love transcending space into an eternal embrace\u2019s trace!    \nIn unity we stand against life's relentless grind  \nTwo beating souls entwined, a symphony refine; for when two hearts do merge as one.",
