      "critique": "**What\u2019s alive:**  \nThe shard as a physical object (cold, jagged, humming) anchors the word\u2019s materiality. The ritual of carving and binding it to the wrist gives the repetition a visceral, almost sacred weight. The final line\u2019s shift from sharpness to an unknown tongue destabilizes the word\u2019s meaning, though it leans toward abstraction.  \n\n**Issues:**  \n- **Abstraction:** The final line\u2019s \u201csings a tongue he does not know\u201d is vague. The shift in meaning lacks concrete imagery to ground the transformation.  \n- **Weak line break:** The line break after \u201cair\u201d weakens the rhythm; the crack\u2019s progression should feel more urgent.  \n- **Clich\u00e9 risk:** \u201cSings\u201d might imply musicality, which could conflate the word\u2019s physicality with metaphor.  \n\n**Direction:**  \nRevise the final line to focus on the word\u2019s physical residue (e.g., a sound, texture, or material) rather than abstract transformation. For example: *\u201cthe word, once sharp, now hums / a frequency his bones remember.\u201d*  \nStrengthen the crack\u2019s progression by linking it to the shard\u2019s materiality (e.g., *\u201ca crack runs through the air, / splitting the shard\u2019s hum into two tones\u201d*).  \n\nThis poem has found its shape.",
