      "draft": "At low tide, a single print in sand \u2014\nthe kind that holds only when the water pulls back,\nonly temporary, which is exactly how\nI found you.\n\nThey said your name on the\u7891\u6587",
      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe impulse to make the footprint the central image \u2014 that is genuinely strong, and it's doing real work: a single mark in soft material, ephemeral, belonging only to someone who vanished. The tension between something physical and unexplained versus the absence of any body is the poem's engine.\n\nThe phrase \"the kind that holds only when the water pulls back\" has tactile specificity \u2014 tide pulling from an impression, sand draining away like a clock's hand. That's earned detail.\n\n---\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Incoherent line break at the end (line 4):**\n\"only temporary, which is exactly how / I found you.\" \u2014 \"I found you\" breaks off into another line with no payoff. The pronoun shift from \"you\" to \"I\" creates a structural turn that needs to be earned through what precedes it and developed after. Right now the break isolates the pronoun as if it's its own revelation, which undermines whatever comes before it. **Direction:** Either make the line break do something (cutting across syntax is legitimate but requires justification), or rewrite so \"I found you\" lands in a sentence that gives context \u2014 what did I find? Where?\n\n**Unclear ending:**\n\"they said your name on the\u7891\u6587\" \u2014 this line doesn't function. \"They\" is a misspelling (likely \"They\"), and \"on the\u7891\u6587\" translates as \"on the stele,\" but nothing before it sets up any context for who's speaking, what language this is in, or why a gravestone matters if there was no body. This reads like a translation fragment grafted onto an English draft. **Direction:** Cut this line entirely unless you can rebuild it into something that connects to the footprint and the erased life with logical inevitability.\n\n**Clich\u00e9: \"At low tide\" (line 1)**\nThis is pure setting, not image. It tells the reader what time of day without earning any sensory detail \u2014 no light quality, no texture, no sound. **Direction:** Replace with something that belongs to this specific disappearance. What does the sand look like? Is there seaweed on it? Salt crystals?\n\n**Weak transition: \"which is exactly how\" (line 3)**\nThis phrase is filler connecting two sentences that could stand alone. It softens what should be a sharp pivot. **Direction:** Cut it or replace with something more physical \u2014 an image of finding the footprint, the act itself.\n\n**Tonal inconsistency:**\nThe poem wants to be about erasure and absence but leans on \"I found you\" as if there's a person to name. That sentimentality undermines the whole project. **Direction:** The poem must stay in the landscape \u2014 the footprint, the tide,",
