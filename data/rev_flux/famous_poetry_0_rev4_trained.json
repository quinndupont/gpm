He walks the dotted line\nshe made with her fear. The crack continues\nthrough the parking lot, under the chain-link fence,\n\nwhere a cardinal sits on a plastic water bottle\nand does not fly.\n\nHe knows what the bird is waiting for.\nHe knows the bottle was once someone's\n\nlifeline, carried to the curb in a glass of iced tea,\nset down and forgotten. The paint has chipped\nso the word *Bud* shows through\u2014buckshot lettering,\n\nblue and pink and white, the way light falls\non things after the sun is gone\nand has no name for itself.\n\nHe does not turn back. He follows\nwhat she left. And where the crack meets\n\nthe concrete border of a garden,\nwhere someone's weed-garden was,\nhe finds a piece of glass\u2014tangerine\u2014\n\npressed into the pavement like a period\nat the end of a sentence nobody finished.\nHe presses his thumb against it.\n\nThe cardinal swallows.",

The bird swallowing is devastating in its quiet. These two actions (touching, leaving) carry more emotional specificity than anything else here.\n\nThe concrete crack as the poem's central object also works. It resists sentimentality because it's practical \u2014 a physical line someone chose not to cross. The geometry vs. beauty moment lands precisely: \"just the geometry\" is a real refusal of Romantic language.\n\nThe detail of the plastic water bottle with *Bud* painted on it does genuine work \u2014 it's specific, material, and earns its place by being strange rather than decorative.\n\n### What Isn't Working\n\n**Sentimentality / editorializing (lines 17\u201320):**\n\"what the bird is waiting for. / He knows what she was thinking. / The bottle was once someone's\"\nThe poem tells us the reader should feel something here instead of trusting the image to produce that feeling itself. \"He knows what the bird is waiting for\" is a sentence that *thinks* it's profound but is actually a thesis statement.
