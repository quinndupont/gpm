      "draft": "In an attic, whispers rise,\nWhere shadows hold memories.\nOld photographs rest side by side,\nEach face a silent story, eyes wide with then.\n\nFingerprints on glass, time\u2019s soft embrace\u2014\nA child in mittens, cheeks rosy, laughing at the lace.\nGhosts of laughter, echoes of seasons past,\nIn these frames, life is still found, not just cast away.\n\nBelow, workshop doors creak open,\nSilent machines hum under moonlit skies.\nHands mold wood with practiced grace,\nPatterns emerge from forgotten tools, dust-heavy spaces.\n\nA saw\u2019s gentle rasp, the scent of pine and sap\u2014\nMagic in every crevice, where light dances, unseen.\nHere, growth is a slow sculpting of heart and hand,\nEach stroke, each turn, an unfolding discovery of stand.\n\nIn the quiet, old souls whisper truths untold,\nOf resilience born from silent toil, patience bold.\nNot just joy shared around firelight\u2019s flicker\u2014\nBut inner magic found in depths where time can\u2019t shiver.",
      "critique": "What's alive:\n- The vivid imagery of old photographs and the workshop setting brings a sense of nostalgia and reflection.\n- The contrast between surface-level togetherness and deeper personal growth is compelling.\n- The sensory details, like the scent of pine and dust, add depth to the poem.\n\nIssues:\n1. **Weak Line Breaks**: Lines 2-3 and 5-6 are too closely linked without clear breaks that could enhance the flow or emphasize key moments.\n   - Direction: Consider breaking lines in a way that separates the description of photographs from the emotional response they evoke, for example: \"Old photographs rest side by side / Each face a silent story, eyes wide with then.\"\n\n2. **Clich\u00e9 Phrases**: The phrase \"magic in every crevice\" is close to a clich\u00e9 and might feel overused.\n   - Direction: Replace it with something more original, such as \"where light dances, unseen / Magic in every grain of wood's embrace.\"\n\n3. **Sentimentality**: There are moments where the poem feels overly sentimental, particularly in lines like \"Not just joy shared around firelight\u2019s flicker\u2014\"\n   - Direction: Tone down this line to maintain a balance between reflection and deeper meaning without leaning too heavily on sentiment.\n\n4. **Abstraction**: The concept of \"inner magic\" is abstract and might benefit from more concrete examples or metaphors.\n   - Direction: Consider grounding the idea with specific actions, such as \"Each stroke, each turn, an unfolding discovery / Of resilience in every grain, a silent vow.\"\n\nWhen done:\nThis poem has found its shape.",
