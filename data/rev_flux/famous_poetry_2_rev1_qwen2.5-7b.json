      "draft": "Whispered shadows danced upon the wall,\nA raven perched, silent as night's embrace.\nIts eyes, deep pools reflecting distant falls,\nWhere leaves still cling to branches' last grace.\n\nThe moon cast silver bars that shifted slow,\nLike restless fingers tracing paths unseen.\nIn every creak and breeze, a voice did grow\nWhispering names of places long since dreamt.\n\nBeneath the oak where sunlight seeped like light,\nA stone cold hand lay waiting in its gloom.\nEach feather rustled like lost dreams aright\u2014\nA raven's song to seasons turned to rumour.\n\nIn silence, time dissolved into a mist,\nAnd shadows leaned toward whispered secrets told.\nThe man stood still as if by some soft list\nHe held the night and all it sought to hold.",
      "critique": "What works:\n- The opening lines create a haunting atmosphere through the imagery of \"whispered shadows\" and \"distant falls.\"\n- The moon's light as \"silver bars\" evokes a sense of both beauty and isolation.\n- The use of natural elements like leaves, oak, and sunlight adds depth to the setting.\n\nWhat isn't working:\n- **Weak line breaks**: Lines 3 and 4 are too closely connected, making it difficult for the reader to pause and absorb the imagery. Consider breaking these lines apart or adjusting their placement.\n- **Clich\u00e9 avoidance issue**: The phrase \"lost dreams aright\" in line 10 is somewhat clich\u00e9d and could be rephrased for more originality.\n- **Overuse of metaphor**: The repeated use of \"whispered\" (lines 2, 7, 9) can become repetitive. Consider varying the language to maintain freshness.\n\nDirections:\n- Break lines 3 and 4 apart: \"Its eyes, deep pools / Reflecting distant falls.\"\n- Replace \"lost dreams aright\" with something more evocative, such as \"shattered whispers.\"\n- Vary the language around \"whispered.\" For example, change line 7 to \"In every creak and breeze, a voice did rise.\"\n\nWhen done:\nThis poem has found its shape.",
