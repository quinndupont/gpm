      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### What's Alive\n\nThe kitchen at 3 AM setting is genuinely earned and does what a brief asked for: it stays quiet where sentiment would shout. The domestic detail of reaching three inches across the counter, thumb finding \"the valley behind my knee / where sleep had packed its foamy settlements\" \u2014 that's specific enough to feel like one real moment rather than a poem about love in general.\n\nThe closing image of the shoulder-touch is precise and understated: \"you'll know,\" but not because anything was said or named. The archaeology metaphor at the end also works as an extension of what's already there, without overreaching.\n\nLine 14 \u2014 \"the terrible obligation of the noticed\" \u2014 lands with real force as a pivot from warmth to something slightly more dangerous and quieter than tenderness.\n\n### What Isn't Working\n\n**Abstraction bloat (lines 20\u201336).** After line 15, the poem abandons its own method. It starts explaining what happened instead of staying in it: \"The quiet between us has always done this,\" \"the thing that happened at 3 is already gone.\" This is the poem *telling* the reader about the experience rather than letting the domestic images do that work. The cereal-eating standing up, the morning toast \u2014 these are gestures toward meaning rather than images. Direction: cut or radically compress everything after line 15. Return to what was happening in the body and kitchen at 3 AM. Let the silence between them be *shown* through physical detail, not narrated.\n\n**Redundancy / structural collapse (lines 29\u201336).** The final nine lines essentially say: \"we won't talk about it,\" \"you'll touch my shoulder again tomorrow,\" \"I'll know.\" This is circular and deflates the poem's energy. Direction: choose one of those three sentences \u2014 or better, find a single image that encapsulates what the last 16 lines *mean* without restating them.\n\n**\"Moss on a rock no one names\" (line 9).** This is decorative figuration. It doesn't do sensory work; it just fills space. Direction: either make this concrete or cut it \u2014 replace with something that touches actual temperature, texture, stillness.\n\n**The poem leans too heavily on negation (\"not about,\" \"without anyone noticing except for those who matter most,\" \"without particular candour\") to establish its subject.** This is meta-commentary doing the work the images should be doing. Direction: trust the kitchen at 3 AM more. The brief already said this was a poem *inside* domestic silence \u2014 so write *inside* it, not about it from outside.\n\n### Summary Direction\n\nThe draft has one fully realized moment (lines 1\u201315). Everything after line",

      "critique": "## Revision Workshop Response\n\n---\n\n### What's Alive\n\nThe opening is the strongest passage. \"The refrigerator hums its low frequency / while the house sleeps with its jaw dropped tongue\" \u2014 that sensory entry, that strange personification of sleep as a creature yawning wide open, earns its place. It sets up a domestic scene without naming it.\n\n\"You moved first. That's what I mean by true\u2014\nhow you reached across three inches of counter,\nthumb finding the valley behind my knee\nwhere sleep had packed its settled foam.\"\n\nThis is where the poem finds its shape: reaching across three inches, thumb pressing into \"the soft valley where sleep had settled.\" The domestic specificity is doing real work \u2014 it's not announcing love but enacting presence. \"Packed its foamy settlements\" is alive because it commits to a single image and holds it.\n\nThe closing gesture of the shoulder-touch in bed has genuine weight: \"you'll know,\" with nothing said, no naming. That's the poem's real subject \u2014 recognition without declaration \u2014 and it arrives cleanly here.\n\n### What Isn't Working\n\n**Redundancy / structural collapse (lines 16\u201335).** After line 15, the poem retreats from its own method. It abandons the kitchen at 3 AM for a general narrative of quiet and unspoken things: \"the quiet between us has always done this,\" \"the thing that happened at three is already gone.\" These are explanations, not images. The cereal-eating standing up, the toast, wiping milk from the floor \u2014 these gestures toward meaning dilute what was precise. Direction: **cut or radically compress everything after line 15**. Return to the kitchen. Let the silence and recognition stay inside three lines total; trust the body's memory.\n\n**Abstraction (lines 20\u201323).** \"The quiet between us has always done this\" \u2014 this is the poem *telling* what happened instead of showing it again. Direction: **replace with one more concrete image from that kitchen at 3 AM**. What does the thermostat feel like pressed against skin? What sound does the refrigerator make after three hours?\n\n**Clich\u00e9 / dead language (lines 24\u201325).** \"The terrible obligation of the noticed\" is abstract moralizing. Direction: **cut entirely or replace with a physical detail** \u2014 something that *enacts* what's meant by obligation.\n\n**Sentimentality (line 31).** \"Morning will come and we'll eat cereal standing up, / the bowl divided, milk spilling on the floor.\" This is domestic life as backdrop, not lived experience. Direction: **either make this image sharper \u2014 what specific gesture? What does the milk do exactly? \u2014 or cut it entirely**.
