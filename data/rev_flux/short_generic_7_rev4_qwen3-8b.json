Replace with a concrete action (e.g., \u201cstretches the clock\u2019s face\u201d or \u201cgrinds the gears\u201d).  \n- **Clich\u00e9:** \u201cMinutes coil like springs in a drawer too tight to open\u201d evokes overused metaphors for tension. Simplify to a single, unexpected image (e.g., \u201cminutes crack like dry ice\u201d).  \n- **Weak line break:** The final lines (\u201cthis quiet that presses, that holds, that folds the air\u2026\u201d) rely on repetition rather than enjambment.
