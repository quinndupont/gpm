You tie it again, knot by knot,  \nthough the answer is already in the fibers.  \nIt\u2019s not the presence that holds\u2014  \njust the weight of the thing, worn smooth  \nby the absence of your touch.",
      "critique": "**What\u2019s alive**:  \nThe poem\u2019s metaphors (hammer, chisel, rope) anchor friendship in tactile, functional persistence. The enjambment mirrors the unspoken flow of connection, and the final lines crystallize the theme of endurance through absence. The concrete nouns (split wood, rust, frayed rope) resist romanticization, grounding emotion in materiality.  \n\n**Issues**:  \n- **Weak line break** (line 1): The abrupt break after \u201ccorner\u201d disrupts the flow of the metaphor. The line could be tightened to maintain the tool\u2019s presence as a continuous image.  \n- **Abstraction** (line 5): \u201cThe way your thumb remembers the curve\u201d introduces a personal, almost sentimental touch. The poem\u2019s strength lies in its materiality; this line risks veering into abstraction.  \n- **Clich\u00e9 risk** (line 10): \u201cThe answer is already in the fibers\u201d leans toward sentimentality. The poem\u2019s power comes from the tools\u2019 quiet persistence; this line softens that edge.  \n\n**Direction**:  \n- Merge line 1 into a single, tighter image (e.g., \u201cIt\u2019s the hammer left in the corner, its head split by a hundred small stones\u201d) to maintain the tool\u2019s presence as a continuous metaphor.  \n- Replace line 5 with a more concrete observation (e.g., \u201cthe grip\u2019s crack holds the weight of your thumb\u2019s old pressure\u201d) to preserve",
