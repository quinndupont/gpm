      "critique": "**What\u2019s alive:**  \nThe poem successfully uses sensory details to imply presence without direct reference (perfume scent, light fractures, coffee stains). Free verse with enjambment stretches lines into pauses, mirroring the unresolved nature of loss. The final line trails into implication, avoiding closure.  \n\n**Issues:**  \n- **Weak line break** in \u201cLight fractures where your absence once pooled, / a door closes without the hinge\u2019s complaint.\u201d The break after \u201cpooled\u201d disrupts the flow of the metaphor.  \n- **Abstraction**",
