The second time\nyou hummed something I recognized\nbut couldn't name until today: a dog bark,\na car engine sputter, the sound\nmy cousin makes when he's happy sleeping.\n\nYou left a ring-shaped stain on the counter\nnear the window where the light hits the tiles at an angle\nthat turns everything into gold for ten seconds.\nI saved that cup. I kept it in the cabinet\nabove my coffee mug, which has a crack\nyou'd never notice\u2014nobody does,\nunless they're looking for cracks.\n\nYears later: me on a street corner\nwaiting for the charger to warm up my phone,\nmy earphones coiled like old newsprint\non a chair pillow. I press play and it's something\nyou must have been listening to weeks ago\u2014\nsome low guitar, some woman singing in a language\nthat isn't mine but that opens doors\nthe way a key left under a doormat\nis finally turned.\n\nYou are the kind of weather I keep forgetting\nto name. The kind where a street lamp turns on\nand every pedestrian stops walking.\nWhere a coffee stain becomes a sun\nif you tilt your head just right.\n\nToday the charger hummed twice before it lit,\nand I thought: someone is about to be connected\nto something they've been leaning toward\nfor years\u2014toward that window, toward that light,\n\ntoward the way you hold your latte.",
      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### What's Alive\n\nThe barista passage is the strongest writing here. \"I watched you twice\" \u2014 that plainness carries real weight because it stays quiet about what watching means. The detail of holding a latte as if it were a phone call \u2014 that's specific, physical, and earns its place without explanation.\n\nThe charger scene also has genuine energy: the repetition of \"twice,\" then \"it lit,\" the body knowledge of waiting for voltage. That moment where technology becomes ritual is alive because it's grounded in something the speaker *does* rather than what they feel about it.\n\nThe poem knows how to trust small, strange details \u2014 and that's where the real work lives: a ring stain on a counter, earphones coiled like old newsprint, the low guitar singing in an unfamiliar language. These are things that don't need to say \"this is love.\"\n\n### What Isn't Working\n\n**Sentimentality / editorializing (lines 23\u201329).** The poem's best instinct \u2014 restraint \u2014 abandons it here and explains what it already showed. \"You are the kind of weather I keep forgetting / to name\" \u2014 this line tells us *about* the relationship, which is exactly what the brief warned against. \"A street lamp turns on / and every pedestrian stops walking\" is a poem's worth of imagery compressed into two lines that flatten everything they describe. **Direction:** Cut or radically compress these closing six lines. The poem already does this work in the charger scene: the speaker *is* watching, waiting, connecting. Trust those lines more.\n\n**Abstraction (throughout).** \"The inevitability of them meeting\" appears twice \u2014 once as a guiding principle and again in line 25 (\"toward that window, toward that light\"). The poem keeps naming what it's about instead of embodying it. \"Soulmate,\" \"forever and more,\" \"true love\" \u2014 these are forbidden by the brief but still hover nearby. **Direction:** Every time a line names the emotional destination (meeting, destiny, connection), replace it with another object or action.\n\n**Clich\u00e9 residue (lines 19\u201320).** \"Everything into gold for ten seconds\" is decorative and generic. It reads as an attempt to make light look precious. **Direction:** Drop this entirely. The stain happens; let the reader decide what it means without being told it's golden.\n\n**Weak line breaks (line 7, line 16).** \"I recognized / but couldn't name until today\" \u2014 breaking on \"but\" is a common default. Same with \"nobody does, / unless they're looking.\" These enjambments don't create tension or surprise; they just split sentences. **Direction:** Break lines where meaning shifts, where the reader gains something by turning the page.\n\n**Repetition without variation (lines 17\u20132",

      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n---\n\n### What's Alive\n\nThe opening barista passage is the strongest writing here. \"I watched you twice\" \u2014 that plainness carries real weight because it stays quiet about what watching means. The detail of holding a latte as if it were a phone call \u2014 that's specific, physical, and earns its place without explanation.\n\nThe charger scene also has genuine energy: the repetition of \"twice,\" then \"it lit,\" the body knowledge of waiting for voltage. That moment where technology becomes ritual is alive because it's grounded in something the speaker *does* rather than what they feel about it.\n\nThe earphones coiled like old newsprint on a chair pillow \u2014 that's an excellent image, concrete and unexpected enough to hold weight without explanation.\n\n---\n\n### What Isn't Working\n\n**Sentimentality / editorializing (lines 23\u201329).** The poem's best instinct \u2014 restraint \u2014 abandons it here and explains what it already showed. \"You are the kind of weather I keep forgetting / to name\" \u2014 this line tells us *about* the relationship, which is exactly what the brief warned against. \"A street lamp turns on\n/ and every pedestrian stops walking\" is a poem's worth of imagery compressed into two lines that flatten everything they describe.\n\n**Direction:** Cut or radically compress these closing six lines. The poem already does this work in the charger scene: the speaker *is* watching, waiting, connecting. Trust those lines more.\n\n---\n\n**Repetition without variation (lines 17\u201320).** \"something you must have been listening to weeks ago\" \u2014 repeated with no shift in context or specificity. \"some low guitar, some woman singing in a language / that isn't mine but that opens doors\" is vague where the earlier images were precise.\n\n**Direction:** Make this repetition land by changing at least one detail each time it recurs. The language should sharpen, not soften.\n\n---\n\n**Abstraction (line 27).** \"You are the kind of weather I keep forgetting / to name.\" This line names the emotional destination \u2014 \"weather,\" \"connection\" \u2014 instead of embodying it. It's a summary of what the poem has been building toward with objects and actions, which undermines those objects and actions.\n\n**Direction:** Replace this line entirely with another image from the world the speaker inhabits. What does forgetting to name look like in a physical sense? A gesture? A habit?\n\n---\n\n**Clich\u00e9 residue (line 19).** \"everything into gold for ten seconds\" \u2014 decorative, generic light-into-gold imagery. It reads as an attempt to make light look precious without earning that feeling through specificity.\n\n**Direction:** Drop this entirely. The stain happens; let the reader decide what it means without being told it's golden.\n\n---\n\n**Weak line breaks (lines 7 and 16).** \"I recognized / but couldn't name until",

      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n---\n\n### What's Alive\n\nThe opening barista passage is the strongest writing here. \"I watched you twice\" \u2014 that plainness carries real weight because it stays quiet about what watching means. The detail of holding a latte as if it were a phone call \u2014 that's specific, physical, and earns its place without explanation.\n\nThe charger scene also has genuine energy: the repetition of \"twice,\" then \"it lit,\" the body knowledge of waiting for voltage. That moment where technology becomes ritual is alive because it's grounded in something the speaker *does* rather than what they feel about it.\n\nThe earphones coiled like old newsprint on a chair pillow \u2014 that's an excellent image, concrete and unexpected enough to hold weight without explanation.\n\n---\n\n### What Isn't Working\n\n**Sentimentality / editorializing (lines 23\u201329).** The poem's best instinct \u2014 restraint \u2014 abandons it here and explains what it already showed. \"You are the kind of weather I keep forgetting / to name\" is a summary of connection, not its embodiment. \"A street lamp turns on\n/ and every pedestrian stops walking\" is a poem's worth of imagery compressed into two lines that flatten everything they describe.\n\n**Direction:** Cut or radically compress these closing six lines. The poem already does this work in the charger scene: the speaker *is* watching, waiting, connecting. Trust those lines more. If the ending must shift, let it land on a single physical gesture \u2014 not a metaphor for meaning.\n\n---\n\n**Repetition without variation (lines 17\u201320).** \"something you must have been listening to weeks ago\" is repeated with no shift in context or specificity. The language should sharpen, not soften.\n\n**Direction:** Make this repetition land by changing at least one detail each time it recurs. The song/language pairing was precise; let that precision survive the return.\n\n---\n\n**Abstraction (line 27).** \"You are the kind of weather I keep forgetting / to name.\" This line names the emotional destination \u2014 \"weather,\" \"connection\" \u2014 instead of embodying it. It's a summary of what the poem has been building toward with objects and actions, which undermines those objects and actions.\n\n**Direction:** Replace this line entirely with another image from the world the speaker inhabits. What does forgetting to name look like in a physical sense? A habit? A gesture?\n\n---\n\n**Clich\u00e9 residue (line 19).** \"everything into gold for ten seconds\" \u2014 decorative, generic light-into-gold imagery. It reads as an attempt to make light look precious without earning that feeling through specificity.\n\n**Direction:** Drop this entirely. The stain happens; let the reader decide what it means without being told it's golden.\n\n---\n\n**Weak line breaks (lines 7 and 16).** \"I recognized / but couldn't name until\" \u2014 the break on",
