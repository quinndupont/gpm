      "draft": "In spring's first blush of verdant hue,\nShe watches daffodils unfurl,\nTheir golden heads shyly peeking through.\nA gentle tug at her skirt, a soft \"Mama?\"\n\nSummer sun burns fierce in ripening skies,\nYet she plants beans and tills the soil with care.\nRipe cucumbers and tomatoes come to thrive.\nHer hands, rough from work, cradle life's small prayer.\n\nAutumn whispers of cool, crisp air,\nLeaves falling like golden coins of time.\nShe wraps them into paper bags for later,\nEach leaf a story of her patient climb.\n\nWinter\u2019s chill cuts through the bone;\nFlakes dance and coat the world in white.\nUnderneath an old quilt from years gone by,\nHer children nestle close to catch their sight.\n\nThrough seasons' cycles, she grows older still,\nYet always watching as buds break ground.\nEach phase a chapter of her steadfast will\u2014\nA mother's bond that cannot be undone.",
      "critique": "What's Alive:\n- The poem effectively uses nature and seasons to symbolize growth, change, and enduring care.\n- The sensory details of spring, summer, autumn, and winter add depth and evoke a strong sense of place.\n\nIssues:\n1. **Weak Line Breaks**: Lines like \"A gentle tug at her skirt, a soft 'Mama?'\" and \"Her hands, rough from work, cradle life's small prayer\" could be more impactful with different breaks.\n2. **Clich\u00e9 Phrases**: The line \"A mother\u2019s bond that cannot be undone\" is a clich\u00e9 and doesn't add new meaning to the poem.\n\nDirections:\n- Experiment with breaking lines in ways that emphasize the action or emotion, such as: \n  - \"A gentle tug at her skirt,  \n   a soft 'Mama?'\" (break after \"skirt\")\n  - \"Her hands, rough from work,  \n   cradle life's small prayer.\" (break after \"work\")\n\n- Replace clich\u00e9 phrases with more original language. For example, instead of \"A mother\u2019s bond that cannot be undone,\" consider: \n  - \"Each phase a chapter of her steadfast will\u2014\n   a love woven through time.\"\n\nThis poem has found its shape.",
