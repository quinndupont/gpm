  "final_poem": "In whispered corners of my mind\nA path unwinds, left behind\nThe fork in road where choices meet\nEchoes of what could have been sweet\n\nI took the one less traveled by\nAnd found a beauty passing by\nUnseen wonders bloomed with every mile\nA tapestry woven from forgotten smiles\n\nBut on that other road, I'm told\nLies a life unlived, a story untold\nRegrets and \"what ifs\" whispered low\nIn dark of night, where shadows grow\n\nThe choice I made changed me, it's true\nAnd shaped the person I've become anew\nA path not taken still resonates deep\nA melody that in silence creeps",
