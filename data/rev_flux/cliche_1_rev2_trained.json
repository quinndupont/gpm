      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### What's Alive\n\nThe structural architecture is genuinely strong. The poem operates in a single domestic scene\u2014potty chair, thermometer, spoon\u2014and builds through escalation: rising temperature \u2192 rising tremor \u2192 rising awareness \u2192 the moment itself. That final line (\"This isn't practice\" / \"This is just the way the day finished\") lands with real force because it reframes everything preceding it; the reader has been watching someone *becoming* a parent, and that shift arrives as revelation rather than declaration.\n\nThe domestic detail does real work: \"the spoon of it anyway, mouth open\" earns its place because it's specific enough to feel like something only this speaker would notice or record. The thermometer blipping \"its slow red warning\"\u2014that's precise observation with tension.\n\nThe earthquake metaphor in lines 16\u201320 is the poem's strongest extended figure: everything undoes without destruction, which captures the physical and emotional truth beautifully. That passage earns its abstraction because it arrives after concrete scenes have built trust.\n\nThe closing image\u2014holding the child's wrist to his mouth while the spoon cools in \"his loose fist\"\u2014is physically grounded and emotionally restrained exactly where the brief asked for restraint. The radio line, while slightly decorative, still functions: it's something that later becomes a song of love, but right now it's just white noise.\n\n### What Isn't Working\n\n**Sentimentality / editorializing (lines 1\u20134):**\n\"She sat on the floor beside the potty chair / and the child's temperature was rising, / a thermometer blipping its slow red warning, / and no one was coming home.\"\nThis opening does too much too soon. \"No one was coming home\" is an emotional summary that undermines the scene's power to establish isolation through domestic detail alone. The poem already proves it can do this in lines 9\u201312 (the thermometer, the milk, the potty). Cut or radically compress the first four lines\u2014let the reader arrive at the same place with less narration.\n\n**Abstraction / summary (lines 16\u201320):**\nThe earthquake metaphor is genuinely good, but \"everything / was built on a fault line nobody mapped\" explains what the poem has already shown. The stillness before the shaking starts gets its own section; then to restate it as earthquake metaphor risks making the poem feel like an essay on vulnerability rather than lived experience. Direction: trust the domestic scene more in this passage, or cut the earthquake language entirely and let the silence do its work again.\n\n**Weak line break (line 24):**\n\"while only them, inside that door,\ndecided everything for both of them at once:\" \u2014 the colon after \"once\" is doing rhetorical punctuation where plain syntax would suffice. It tells the reader what to feel before the line turn does its own work. Remove it.\n\n**Clich\u00e9 (line 29):**\n\"But she didn't",

      "critique": "## Revision\n\n---\n\n### Angle\nThe poem should stay inside the domestic scene and let the reader feel everything through physical detail \u2014 not through editorial commentary or summary. The mother's doubt and strength are both present in what she does with her hands, spoon, wrist, mouth. The ending line (\"This isn't practice\") is already doing this well; the revision needs to build toward it without explaining.\n\n### Clich\u00e9s to Avoid\n- \"I love you more than words can say\"\n- \"You're my everything\"\n- \"A mountain of love between us\"\n- \"My heart stops when I see you\" (or any variation)\n- \"Unconditional\u2014my forever\"\n- \"You make me feel like a champion\"\n\n### Imagery Domain\nThe imagery lives inside the potty chair, thermometer, spoon, milk, shaking hands, fluorescent light, worn-out pajamas. The silence before crying. The body's small tremors in wrist and arm. No landscape or weather beyond what's visible from inside the hallway.\n\n### Form Guidance\nWrite in short lines or broken syntax that mimics breath catching \u2014 no rhyme scheme, minimal punctuation (comma where a comma would go). Let each word do its own work; no rhetorical flourish at the line breaks.\n\n---\n\n## Revised Draft\n\nShe sat on the floor beside the potty chair,\nand the child's temperature was rising.\nA thermometer blipped its slow red warning.\nThe room smelled like iodine and milk left out too long.\n\nHer hands shook. Not with rage.\nNot yet anything recognizable as a name\u2014\njust that stillness, that barely breathing\n\nbefore the shaking starts.
