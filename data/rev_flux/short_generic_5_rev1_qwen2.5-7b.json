      "draft": "In the humdrum of screens aglow,\nWhispers through waves of digital flow.\nSignals dance, then fade into noise\u2014\nBridges built, only to crumble in choice.\n\nEchoes from apps where once we sought connection,\nNow mere static fills our conversation's section.\nSilent pixels fail to speak love\u2019s language,\nIn the quiet corners where hearts begin and end their range.\n\nTransmissions crackle with unspoken pain,\nWhile algorithms plot unseen again.\nDevices that promised a world without divide\u2014\nHave become mirrors, reflecting what we hide.",
      "critique": "What's alive:\n- The contrast between digital signals and human emotions is effectively explored.\n- The imagery of \"whispers through waves\" and \"signals dance, then fade into noise\" creates a vivid picture of the tension between connection and disconnection.\n\nIssues:\n1. **Weak Line Breaks**: Lines 2 and 3 could benefit from a stronger line break to separate the description of screens from the metaphorical description of signals.\n   - Direction: Consider breaking line 3 after \"waves,\" which would help emphasize the contrast between the physical presence of devices and the fluctuating nature of digital communication.\n\n2. **Abstraction**: The phrase \"Bridges built, only to crumble in choice\" is somewhat abstract and could be more concrete or metaphorical.\n   - Direction: Try rephrasing this line to make it clearer what choices are being referred to, perhaps linking them directly to actions taken with devices.\n\n3. **Sentimentality**: The last stanza begins to veer into a more general sentiment about technology's failure, which might lose the specific focus on loss and connection.\n   - Direction: Refine the final lines to maintain the specific focus on how devices both bridge and widen emotional gaps without becoming overly broad or abstract.\n\nRevised Draft:\n---\nIn the humdrum of screens aglow,\nWhispers through waves of digital flow.\nSignals dance, then fade into noise\u2014\nBridges built, only to crumble in choice.\n\nEchoes from apps where once we sought connection,\nNow mere static fills our conversation's section.\nSilent pixels fail to speak love\u2019s language,\nIn the quiet corners where hearts begin and end their range.\n\nTransmissions crackle with unspoken pain,\nWhile algorithms plot unseen again.\nDevices that promised a world without divide\u2014\nHave become mirrors, reflecting what we hide in code.\n\nThis poem has found its shape.",
