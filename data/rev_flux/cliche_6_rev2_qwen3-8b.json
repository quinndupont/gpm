The body remembers  \nbefore the mind: a knee lifts, a step hesitates,  \na breath holds its shape like a paused film  \nbefore the frame rewinds. No spark, no fate\u2014  \njust the mechanics of a gaze that once  \nlocked onto a target, then dissolved  \ninto the noise, leaving only the afterimage  \nof a signal received, uninterpreted,  \nand the crowd\u2019s hum resuming its hum.",

The avoidance of clich\u00e9s (no spark, fate, soulmates) and the focus on mechanics (gaze as a coded pulse, afterimage) align with the angle. The closing lines (\u201csignal received, uninterpreted\u201d) evoke the tension between recognition and erasure effectively.  \n\n**What isn\u2019t working**:  \n- **Rhyme scheme failure** (lines 2, 4, 6, 8): The expected AA BB CC DD pattern is absent.
