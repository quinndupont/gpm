      "draft": "In the scrape of metal on concrete,  \na hand tightens around a wrench,  \nthe knuckles white, veins pulse like city pulses\u2014  \ntraffic jolts, but here, steady heartbeats under leather gloves.\n\nVoices meld into whistles and coughs,  \na symphony without crescendos.  \nA hammer cracks, resounding in empty air\u2014  \nechoes trapped by steel, rebounding silent.\n\nFootsteps thud on the cold floor,  \nthe weight of time pressing down on ankles like chains\u2014\neach step a song, lost to a void,\nthe rhythm only known by those who walk it daily.\n\nWhirring drones of machines drone on,  \na deafening dance of shadows and gears.  \nA siren wails in the distance,  \nlike distant screams held captive within walls of silence\u2014\n\nHands weave through wires, disconnect, reconnect\u2014\neach wire a thread, binding to unseen circuits,\nthe mind a map navigating uncharted territories.\n\nIn the crackle of static on radios,  \nwhispers of plans and prayers\u2014a fleeting moment's truth.  \nA worker leans against the wall, closes eyes\u2014\nin this quiet, finds his pulse with something less than hope.",
      "critique": "What's Alive:\n- The tactile and auditory imagery effectively captures the environment of a factory or construction site.\n- The enjambment mimics the irregularity of industrial sounds, creating a sense of rhythm and movement.\n\nIssues:\n1. **Abstraction**: Lines like \"traffic jolts, but here, steady heartbeats under leather gloves\" are somewhat abstract and could be more concrete in their imagery.\n2. **Weak Line Breaks**: Some line breaks do not serve the poem's structure or meaning effectively. For example, \"A hammer cracks, resounding in empty air\u2014echoes trapped by steel, rebounding silent.\" This line break disrupts the flow of the rhythm and does not enhance the auditory experience.\n\nDirections:\n1. **Concrete Imagery**: Replace abstract phrases with more specific details. For instance, instead of \"steady heartbeats under leather gloves,\" consider something like \"the steady throb of a hand gripping cold metal.\"\n2. **Refine Line Breaks**: Ensure line breaks support the poem's rhythm and meaning. Consider breaking lines to emphasize pauses or to create a sense of the work environment. For example, rework the line break in the hammer section: \n   - Original: \"A hammer cracks, resounding in empty air\u2014echoes trapped by steel, rebounding silent.\"\n   - Revised: \"A hammer cracks, resounding in empty air\u2014\\nEchoes trapped by steel, rebounding silent.\"\n\nWhen done:\nThis poem has found its shape.",
