      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe poem has genuine emotional specificity in its domestic scenes \u2014 the worn blue yarn of an accent chair, frost on glass persisting \"all day if it wants to,\" the mug held without drinking from it, thumb tracing a rim that's \"just / a circle of heat against the cold of you.\" These are moments where the poet is looking at actual things rather than reaching for feeling. The passage beginning \"He brings both mugs into the bedroom\" through to \"Frost still lives on the window\" earns its space because each image does real work \u2014 the dripping faucet, the accent chair's worn yarn, the frost described as something that *wants* to stay.\n\nThe ending sequence (drinking-from-nothing mug, thumb tracing a rim) has quiet structural power. The poem arrives at its central claim \u2014 love as habit rather than declaration \u2014 through action and object detail, not statement.\n\nThe line \"he holds it there against his thumb / the way you hold a door for someone who hasn't arrived\" is one of the sharpest single images in the piece. It's specific, physical, and earns metaphor without overreaching.\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Sentimentality / editorializing \u2014 lines 37\u201340:**\n> You can see him from the window\n> pulling on his jacket, watching fog lift off\n> a parking lot two streets over. He doesn't move it\u2014\n> he lets the fog do what fog does,\n> which is obscure and then let go.\n>\n> Neither of you says anything about love.\n> The word would flatten whatever this is\u2014\n\nThe final four lines are where the poem stops trusting itself. \"Fog lift off / a parking lot\" reads like a greeting card line \u2014 fog lifting from a surface, dissipating. More importantly, \"the word would flatten whatever this is\" and \"this is not even a height but a weight you carry under your coat\" are *explaining* the poem's own meaning to the reader. The image of holding love \"under your coat\" is sentimental in a way that undermines everything else \u2014 it's vague, domestic-scale language given too much weight.\n\n**Direction:** Cut or radically compress this passage. Let him watching the fog be the image; let the final gesture (the mug held without drinking) do what the explanation tries to do. Trust the reader and trust the objects.\n\n**Clich\u00e9 / dead phrasing \u2014 line 1:**\n> The radiator ticks its slow accounting\n\nThis is a stock poetic opening, personification that costs nothing because it's generic. It sets up atmosphere without specificity.\n\n**Direction:** Replace with something observed from *this* radiator in *this* room. What does it actually sound like? Is it clicking or hissing or making water noises? Make the image particular to this scene.\n\n**Weak line break \u2014 lines 13\u2013",

      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe domestic detail is the strongest engine here: frost on glass, worn blue yarn of an accent chair, a mug held without being drunk from, steam settling on a window like \"something almost there.\" The poem earns its quiet by *showing* habit through objects and actions rather than naming \"love\" or \"habits.\"\n\nThe line\n> His back is turned. Steam rises / from one cup and settles on the window,\n> where it looks like something almost beautiful\u2014\nis close to working \u2014 that dash creates a real pause, and \"almost beautiful\" resists easy sentimentality because of its proximity to the image.\n\nThe closing sequence (mug held without drinking, thumb tracing rim) has structural power. The poem arrives at its central claim through action and object detail, not statement.\n\n### 2.

More critically, \"the word would flatten whatever this is\" and \"this is not even a height but a weight you carry under your coat\" are *telling* the reader what to feel and understand.

      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe domestic detail is the strongest engine here: frost on glass, worn blue yarn of an accent chair, a mug held without being drunk from it, steam settling on a window like \"something almost there.\" The poem earns its quiet by *showing* habit through objects and actions rather than naming \"love\" or \"habits.\"\n\nThe line\n> His back is turned. Steam rises / from one cup and settles on the window,\n> where it looks like something almost beautiful\u2014\nis close to working \u2014 that dash creates a real pause, and \"almost beautiful\" resists easy sentimentality because of its proximity to the image.\n\nThe closing sequence (mug held without drinking, thumb tracing rim) has structural power. The poem arrives at its central claim through action and object detail, not statement.\n\n---\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Sentimentality / editorializing \u2014 final passage: lines 37\u201340**\n> You can see him from the window\n> pulling on his jacket, watching fog lift off\n> a parking lot two streets over. He doesn't move it\u2014\n> he lets the fog do what fog does,\n> which is obscure and then let go.\n>\n> Neither of you says anything about love.\n> The word would flatten whatever this is\u2014\n\nThis passage *explains* the poem's own meaning to the reader, undoing everything else. \"Fog lift off\" reads like a greeting card line \u2014 fog lifting from a surface. More critically, \"the word would flatten whatever this is\" and \"this is not even a height but a weight you carry under your coat\" are *telling* the reader what to feel and understand. The final image (holding love \"under your coat\") is vague, domestic-scale language given too much weight.\n\n**Direction:** Cut or radically compress. Let him watching the fog be the image; let the mug held without drinking do what the explanation tries to do. Trust the objects. Trust the reader.\n\n---\n\n### 3.

Imagery Domain\n\nThe domestic landscape at 6:05 AM in winter light. Frost on glass, worn sheets, the sound of someone still asleep snuffling. The body as a place where love lives rather than an object for admiration.\n\n---\n\n### Revision Direction\n\n**Cut or radically compress lines 37\u201340 entirely.** Replace with something physical \u2014 what's seen from that window, what the speaker actually does",

What's Alive\n\nThe domestic architecture is precise and earns its place:\n\n- **\"footsteps on linoleum sound like old letters, / re-read so many times the envelope is transparent.\"** The metaphor of footsteps becoming read-through letters works because it builds through syntax \u2014 you hear the footsteps *as* a repeated action that erodes an object.
