      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe central conceit \u2014 a body freezing in place while the world moves behind it, and that gap becoming a kind of captivity \u2014 is genuinely strong. The line \"My ribs became the kind of fist / that doesn't unclench\" has real physical specificity; it earns its metaphor by grounding it in muscle memory rather than snowscapes. The shift from \"frozen\" to \"bioned\" (a word I assume was meant as \"betrayed,\" but is more electric) in line 7 creates a moment of genuine strangeness that works.\n\nThe closing movement \u2014 the idea that temperature becomes meaningless when your body controls it, and that someone waits not for spring but for your availability \u2014 has real philosophical charge. That's a genuinely interesting proposition, and the poem earns its right to explore it.\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Abstraction bloat (lines 13\u201326).** The second half of this draft is almost entirely abstract speculation. \"A state where temperature means nothing\" \u2014 that's the thesis statement, not the poem. After line 7, nearly every line retreats from the body into generalized musings about time, weather, waiting. **Direction:** Cut or compress everything past line 12 to return to the body on ice. The poem's engine is in lines 1\u20138. Trust it.\n\n**Clich\u00e9 and dead language (throughout).** \"Time combed my hair in circles\" \u2014 decorative metaphor doing no physical work. \"My metabolism slows down / to match the clock on a refrigerator\" \u2014 this is a neat image, but it's explaining itself rather than enacting anything. \"A softening shroud that doesn't press / but hints at a future where the holes / in socks become whole again\" \u2014 three lines of defamiliarization followed by something that restates the idea without deepening it. **Direction:** Each image needs to carry one more layer of sensory detail or functional logic. If an image can be explained in prose, it's not yet alive on the page.\n\n**Line breaks (throughout).** Many lines break at syntactic joints where a comma would suffice \u2014 \"I was becoming not cold butinged,\" and \"My metabolism slows down / to match the clock on a refrigerator\" are examples. The double dash in line 24 (\"someone reading through a window they / can never stop being\") creates an awkward hanging fragment without rhythmic payoff. **Direction:** Use enjambment to create tension or surprise, not simply to fill space.\n\n**Sentimentality (final stanza).** \"I was not dying. I was learning\" \u2014 this is the poem telling the reader what to feel and believe at the moment of maximum ambiguity. The weather metaphor in lines 21\u201326 (\"small windows in the ice,\" \"someone else's / weather\") resolves into neat aphor",
