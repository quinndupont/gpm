      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe closing four lines \u2014 \"in the heat of its own daf\u00fcrto\" and the final image of the eye carrying a frequency home \u2014 land with genuine strangeness. The word \"daf\u00fcrto\" (likely meant as \"for the warmth,\" or some German construction) creates a real disorientation: something that feels like translation error, which is itself the subject. That's the poem's best trick.\n\nThe scene where she sorts microtiter plates by hand and her thumb finds his eye \"the way a squeezer finds the nipple of a balloon\" \u2014 this earns its metaphor because it stays in the domain of accident and contamination rather than sliding into sentimentality. The specificity of \"a squeezer finds the nipple of a balloon\" is precise enough to feel observed.\n\nThe structural pivot at \"do not ask what this means\" works as a hinge: it lets the poem step back from its own narrative and admit that meaning isn't the point, which reinforces the angle in one clean stroke.\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Overcrowding / Excessive Information (lines 13\u201324).** The poem's real problem is that it tries to carry too much freight at once \u2014 accident, contamination protocol, disinfection, the supervisor, the centrifuge, the red stain on glass. This creates a feeling of summary rather than experience. By line 15 (\"the red / diluting faster than either can explain\"), the poem has already narrated what it should have dramatized. The reader is told about the spill and the exposure; we're not *in* any of these moments with enough sensory detail to feel them.\n\n**Direction:** Cut at least two full \"informational\" lines \u2014 something like \"the word never comes\" or \"she sorts microtiter plates by hand.\" Choose one concrete scene and let it breathe. The poem is stronger in the corridor opening (lines 1\u20134) than it is in its own middle.\n\n**Clich\u00e9 resurgence (line 25).** \"The true report \u2014 a violation / of protocol so fundamental\" drifts toward bureaucratic boilerplate, which undermines the anti-ode stance. It names what happened instead of letting the image do that work.\n\n**Direction:** Replace this with an image as concrete as \"a squeezer finds the nipple.\" The violation should be *seen* in the language, not announced.\n\n**Line 29 (\"storing a wavelength, a frequency\").** This is abstraction dressed in scientific gloss. It tells us about attention without earning it through specificity.\n\n**Direction:** What does she actually do with her eye during this moment? The poem gestures at \"storing\" but never shows the body doing anything that *would* store. Direction: write what her hand, or posture, or breath is doing while she's sorting plates.\n\n### 3.
