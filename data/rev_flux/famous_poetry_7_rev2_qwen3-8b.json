      "critique": "**What\u2019s alive:**  \nThe poem\u2019s tech metaphors (code, circuits, signals) effectively refract the tension between choice and consequence. The free verse structure mirrors the irreversibility of decisions, and the enjambment (\u201ca constellation of \u2018might-have-beens\u2019 / glowing in the dark\u201d) avoids sentimentality by grounding abstraction in concrete imagery. The final lines (\u201cgrinding the future / into a shape / you can\u2019t unspin\u201d) evoke the weight of choice without relying on clich\u00e9d regret.  \n\n**Issues:**  \n- **Abstraction:** \u201cHumming with different frequencies\u201d is vague; the metaphor lacks specificity to anchor the reader.",
