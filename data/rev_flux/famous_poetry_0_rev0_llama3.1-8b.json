  "final_poem": "A traveler stood, amidst the golden glow\nOf sun-kissed trees that stretched towards the sky\nTwo roads converged before him to and fro\nA choice awaited him, of path or nigh\n\nHe weighed the options with an uncertain mind\nThe well-trodden road a safer route it seemed\nBut something whispered in his troubled heart's design\nTo take the lesser path, where wild things gleam\n\nWith hesitance he stepped onto the unexplored way\nLeaving behind the worn and winding course\nOf familiar feet that trod this path by day\nHe chose instead to venture into the obscure force",
