      "draft": "Through verdant valleys, rivers wind their way,\nVeins of life that meander day by day.\nForests shift in hues like time's soft play,\nAutumn leaves alight with transient fray.\n\nSpring whispers secrets to unfurled leaf buds\u2014\nChoices stirred, a murmur on the breeze.\nSummer scatters seeds beneath sun-baked mud,\nRoots grow entwined where paths were once at ease.\n\nWinter's frosty fingers weave through bare limbs,\nGuarding stories in silent, still white clouds.\nFrom autumn's blaze to summer's verdant climes,\nEach season whispers life with gentle wounds.\n\nRivers carve their courses deep and wide\u2014\nTheir waters course beneath the earth below.\nTides of change they carry, side by side,\nWhere once distinct streams now flow as one row.\n\nIn every bend, in every meandering thread,\nThe tapestry of choices softly winds.\nNot roads that part but threads that braid indeed,\nInterlacing journeys through time's kinder minds.",
      "critique": "What works:\n- The imagery of natural elements like rivers, forests, and seasons effectively symbolizes the passage of time and change.\n- The internal rhymes in \"buds\u2014/ Choices\" and \"wounds\u2014/ winds\" create a lyrical quality that enhances the flow.\n\nIssues:\n- **Weak Line Breaks**: Some lines feel too long or could benefit from shorter breaks to emphasize key phrases. For example, line 4 (\"Autumn leaves alight with transient fray\") could be split into two lines: \"Autumn leaves alight / With transient fray.\"\n- **Clich\u00e9 Phrases**: The phrase \"side by side\" in line 16 is a subtle clich\u00e9 that can be replaced to maintain the poem's originality.\n- **Overuse of Alliteration and Internal Rhymes**: While these devices create a lyrical quality, they are overused. Consider reducing their frequency or using them more selectively.\n\nDirections:\n- Split lines where natural pauses occur, such as \"Autumn leaves alight / With transient fray.\"\n- Replace \"side by side\" with \"parallel paths\" to avoid the clich\u00e9.\n- Reduce the number of internal rhymes and alliteration. For instance, consider changing \"winds\" in line 18 to a different word that maintains the lyrical quality but avoids repetition.\n\nWhen these adjustments are made, this poem has found its shape.",
