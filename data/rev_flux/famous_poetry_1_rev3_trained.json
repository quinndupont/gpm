I kept track of us\nthe way a barometer keeps track of truth:\nby leaning forward, by refusing flat.\n\nThen October came and neither of us\ndid what we were trained to do. You didn't\ndisappear the way they promised\u2014\nyou just became the direction\nof the wind. Something I could stand behind,\n\ncould even hold my coat against.\n\nI wasn't better off. The thermostats\nstayed at sixty-two, which is your temperature,\nwhich is not a setting but an ocean\npulling tide from tide. I learned to describe\n\nmy climate now in terms of what moves through it:\na high from the west bringing fronts\nof snow that settle on the roofs of houses\nyou helped me buy.
