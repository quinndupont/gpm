      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe central conceit \u2014 the bird as covert transmitter, surveillance through domestic objects \u2014 is genuinely compelling. The poem earns its strangeness by building a concrete world where things like cracks in grout and coffee going cold carry hidden meaning. \"Something slipped there, digital, / small as a feather barb\" lands because it's specific: the scale shifts from human to avian, and that compression *is* the metaphor working.\n\nThe closing sequence (grout holding its breath, the bird watching back) earns closure without announcing itself. The poem trusts the reader at the end, which is rare in this genre.\n\nLine 10 \u2014 \"something slipped there, digital\" \u2014 is a precise, almost clinical line that does real work: it names surveillance without explaining it.\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Clich\u00e9 proximity / near-misses (lines 5\u20136):**\n- \"Its head tilted like a screen / giving me an image\" \u2014 the simile to a screen is doing what the poem's own conceit is already accomplishing. The bird itself, standing on the counter, has already suggested a screen displaying something to the speaker. The simile doesn't add anything.\n- **Direction:** Cut or replace with something that doesn't flatten the metaphor into illustration.\n\n**Abstraction bloat (lines 13\u201317):**\n- \"I said *hello* the way you speak / to a door that's slightly open\" \u2014 this is the poem explaining its own meaning. The reader should feel the unease without being told it's unease.\n- \"expecting someone inside\" \u2014 same problem in reverse: the ambiguity of addressing an open door has been there since line 1, no need for restatement.\n- **Direction:** Remove or radically compress this passage. Let the bird's watching stand as the implication. The poem is stronger without the speaker naming their own discomfort.\n\n**Weak transitional line (line 9):**\n- \"The bird didn't blink\" \u2014 a dead beat. It does nothing but set up the next line, which is almost a paraphrase of what the previous lines already did.\n- **Direction:** Cut this line entirely and let the call/word link follow from the coffee or phone image with more force.\n\n**Redundancy / padding (line 16):**\n- \"it practiced in another room\u2014the\" \u2014 the poem has already established surveillance. The word *rehearsing* is doing nothing that \"practiced\" doesn't do better.\n- **Direction:** Remove \"the,\" and if \"rehearsing\" stays, it needs to earn its weight by arriving at something more specific than \"a word.\"\n\n**Line 18 ending on a dash creates a weak pause.** The enjambment into the next line is predictable.\n\n### Revision Direction\n\nThe poem has found its shape from lines 5",

      "critique": "## Revision Workshop Response\n\n---\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe crack in the grout holding a frequency \u2014 that's the poem's strongest moment. It's specific, physical, and carries the surveillance conceit without editorializing. \"Something slipped there, digital, / small as a feather barb\" is precise; it earns its strangeness by being measured.\n\nLine 10 (\"something slipped there, digital\") works because it names what the crack in grout already implied \u2014 information transmission through an ordinary surface. The poem trusts the reader here and doesn't explain itself.\n\nThe closing sequence (grout holding its breath, the bird watching back) earns closure without announcing itself. The poem is stronger at the end for having cut \"My mouth went dry\" \u2014 that line was the speaker narrating their own unease; the dry mouth is already visible in the body before it's named.\n\nLine 12 (\"as if rehearsing something / it practiced in another room\") has genuine tension, even though \"practiced\" and \"rehearsing\" are slightly redundant. The bird's mimicry of a word spoken earlier still works as a quiet revelation without needing to be labeled \"surveillance.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2.
