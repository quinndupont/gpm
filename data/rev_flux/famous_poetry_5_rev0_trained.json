  "final_poem": "A cardinal, bright as a ribbon pulled from red silk,\nlands where the porch railing drops its shadow\u2014\nthe exact place I was not looking but should have been.\nIt does not turn. It thinks the stone is part of morning.\n\nFrom my kitchen window I am just a frame now,\na wooden border on a print the bird has come to read.\nIts head tilts left, then right, as if confirming\nsome sentence it had only half memorized.\n\nI could step outside. I could open the screen door\nand let the cardinal jump the span between us,\nbut something\u2014maybe not fear exactly, more like\nthe principle of a shutter already closed\u2014keeps me seated.\n\nThe bird examines a crack in the mortar.\nA single feather lifts from its breast\nand rides the cold air the way a word\nescapes a mouth before the sentence is finished,\n\nalready gone, already lost, already\npart of something else. The cardinal\ndoes not move. It has found what it came for\u2014\na small dark shape, a food particle suspended\u2014\n\nwhile I am studying how light changes\nthe color of a thing that does not care.\nIt tilts its head again. It is almost,\nvery nearly, the way attention bends toward something\n\nthat has bent itself to be noticed.\n\nThen it rises\u2014not flapping, more like\na nail unscrewed from thought\u2014and flies\nthe ten feet to the hydrangea where a sparrow waits,\nand they are both inside their own business\n\nas I sit here with the window open wider now,\nthe room full of the cold, the feeders ringing,\nand nothing between us but the bright fact\nof what happens when a creature comes down the walk\n\nnot knowing it has been named.",
