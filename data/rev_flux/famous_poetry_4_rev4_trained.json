I'll say it:\nyou were outgunned. Your trowel rusted.\nYour trowel \u2014 that was the last thing\n\nI heard, actually, the metal\ndragging across concrete like a tongue\nagainst something it has forgotten,\nand then even that left the building,\n\nleft the neighborhood, left its square block\nof one apartment building and one parking lot\nwhere I lived with my mother's silence\nand her collecting, and the dog\n\nand the good yogurt gone overnight\nthe way milk does in warm weather \u2014\nits skin stretched taut across a new transparency,\na kind of second skin,\n\nwhich is what I was under.\nWhich is what you missed.\n\nThe faucet had been dripping since Wednesday.\nI knew it. You'd have too, if you weren't\n\nso busy being death.\nSo busy: your suit coat hung on the banister,\nyour hat on its nail, and somewhere\ninside that hat a feather\n\nwas rotating \u2014 or was that my own\nidea of rotation, floating thing\nno one can prove? \u2014 while I lay\nbeneath the sheet with its wrinkle memory,\n\nholding still for it,\nthe way you hold still in photographs.\n\nI want to say: I outsmarted you.\nThat's not it. It's more like\nwe were both late, we were both\nstanding at the wrong bus stop\n\nand something warmer happened:\nmy body lowered into the mattress\nthe way water finds its level\nthrough no effort at all,\n\nand you stood there in your coat,\nyour hat, your ineffable business,\nwatching the clock on the wall\ntick toward three a.m., which was never\ngoing to be morning.",
      "critique": "## Workshop Response\n\n### 1. What's Alive\n\nThe central conceit \u2014 death as a doorman who arrives late and leaves early, outmaneuvered by sleep \u2014 is genuinely original. The poem earns this setup through specific domestic detail: \"the radiator hiccupped its last / by nine,\" the siren tuning to nothing, the dog yawn on the couch. These are small, precise observations that build a world where death simply doesn't register until someone notices it missing.\n\nThe feather inside the hat \u2014 that's a real image. It earns its strangeness because it arrives late enough in the poem and is anchored by the preceding physical reality of the coat, the hat on the nail. The reader trusts the domestic landscape before the surreal intrudes.\n\nThe closing four lines (\"water finds its level / through no effort at all\") land hard precisely because they're so understated after the accumulation that precedes them. That's good craft \u2014 trust the ending to be plain.\n\nThe poem knows what it wants: a domestic scene where death is literally absent from consciousness, and the speaker only later fills in \"I wasn't actually dead.\" The doorman metaphor does real work.\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Sentimentality / self-explanation (lines 31\u201340).** After nearly twenty lines of concrete imagery, the poem opens a window into its own consciousness and *tells us what it means*. \"I'll say it: you were outgunned,\" \"So busy being death,\" \"I outsmarted you\" \u2014 this is the poem explaining itself to the reader instead of letting the image do that work. The final section (lines 31\u201340) is almost entirely expository, and it undermines everything before it by narrating what we already felt from the radiator, siren, dog yawn.\n\n**Direction:** Cut or radically compress lines 31\u201340. Replace them with one more concrete image \u2014 something that *shows* the speaker's awareness without naming \"I\" or \"you.\" The poem doesn't need to say it outsmarted death; it can demonstrate it through a single gesture, object, or moment of waking.\n\n**Clich\u00e9 / abstraction (line 27).** \"Your trowel \u2014 that was the last thing\" \u2014 this line reaches for profundity and lands on a clich\u00e9 dressed in minimalism. A trowel is doing heavy lifting elsewhere; here it becomes a symbol (\"your tool, your trade\") rather than an actual object. Direction: Give the trowel one physical detail no other trowel has. Make it *specific*.\n\n**Clich\u00e9 (line 21).** \"Your suit coat hung on the banister\" \u2014 this reads like a greeting-card image of death's paraphernalia. The hat on its nail is better; that's precise and strange enough. Direction: Either sharpen both objects",

What's Alive\n\nThe radiator hiccupping at nine o'clock \u2014 that is the poem's real engine, and it works hard: a sound that registers as both domestic fact and dying breath.

It's specific, strange, and earns its place by being tied immediately to the radiator and sheet. The detail does double work: it's a physical thing *and* a gap-imagery precursor.\n\nThe hat-as-moon-on-nail image (lines 29\u201331) is the poem's strongest extended figure. It stays strange, visual, grounded in light, and earns its strangeness through accumulation rather than explanation.\n\n\"Pressed myself flat as evidence\" \u2014 that verb \"pressed\" and \"flat\" against the mattress seam works hard; it's a body acting without self-commentary. The closing four lines, stripped of the final section, still hold real weight.\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Sentimentality / self-explanation (lines 31\u201340).** This is the poem's central problem. \"I don't mean that as a sentence\" \u2014 the poem tells us what it means in plain language precisely when it should be *showing* more. The closing four lines (\"water finds its level,\" \"something civil carries on\") are the most abstract and least earned material. They're the poet explaining their own meaning to themselves.\n\n**Direction:** Cut or radically compress everything from line 31 onward entirely. Let the final image (radiator settling, that was last sound) do all the work. If the poem needs one sentence of self-commentary \u2014 and it almost certainly doesn't \u2014 put it somewhere earlier where it won't flatten the ending.\n\n**Abstraction / explanation (lines 27\u201330).** \"Sleep had simply finished with me\" is death-as-personification dressed in plain language. \"The heavy particles settling near the surface where they could almost read their own reflections\" reaches for profundity without landing on anything concrete.\n\n**Direction:** Replace lines 27\u201330 with one or two physical gestures \u2014 something a body does while still asleep, something that *demonstrates* waking without naming it. The dog yawn is working; the radiator settling is working. Trust those more than the prose between them.\n\n**Redundancy / structural collapse (lines 17\u201320).** \"The sheet held the crease of my thigh\" appears twice in close succession \u2014 first as a detail, then again as part of the extended reflection. The dog shifts (line 16) is repeated (line 23).\n\n**Direction:** Cut one instance entirely. Line 2",

It stays strange, visual, grounded in light, and earns its strangeness through accumulation rather than explanation.\n\n\"Pressed myself flat as evidence\" \u2014 that verb \"pressed\" and \"flat\" against the mattress seam works hard; it's a body acting without self-commentary. The closing four lines, stripped of the final section, still hold real weight.\n\n---\n\n### 2. What Isn't Working\n\n**Sentimentality / self-explanation (lines 31\u201340).**\n*Lines: \"I don't mean that as a sentence\" through \"leaving the key in the lock as though that were the point.\"*\n- **Failure type:** The poem explains its own meaning to the reader. This is the central problem.\n- **Direction:** Cut or radically compress everything from line 31 onward entirely. Let the closing four lines (\"radiator settled,\" \"that was last sound\") do all the work. If the poem needs one sentence of self-commentary \u2014 and it almost certainly doesn't \u2014 put it somewhere earlier where it won't flatten the ending.\n\n**Abstraction / explanation (lines 27\u201330).**\n*Lines: \"Sleep had simply finished with me\" through \"the heavy particles settling near the surface where they could almost read their own reflections.\"*\n- **Failure type:** Abstract personification doing the work that images should do.\n- **Direction:** Replace lines 27\u201330 with one or two physical gestures \u2014 something a body does while still asleep, something that *demonstrates* waking without naming it. The dog yawn is working; the radiator settling is working. Trust those more than the prose between them.\n\n**Redundancy / structural collapse (lines 17\u201320).**\n*Lines: \"The sheet held a crease where my hip had been\" repeated, \"the dog yawned\" repeated.*\n- **Failure type:** Repetition without development.\n- **Direction:** Cut one instance entirely. Line 20 (\"Her whole face / shifted its five missing teeth at me like a question\") is already doing the work of line 16",

  "final_poem": "Doorman, Your Shift Is Over\n\nThe radiator hiccupped its last\nby nine. Somewhere outside the apartment\na siren pulled back, left running,\nits one note tuning to nothing.\n\nI wasn't sleeping yet \u2014 I was underneath it all,\nmy jaw gone soft as plaster in warm water.\nThe dog yawned on the couch and her whole face\nshifted its four remaining teeth at me like a question\nI had already answered.\n\nSleep hadn't come. Sleep had thinned its presence\nto a membrane between one thing and nothing, and I was\non the wrong side of it.\n\nYou were still standing in the hall \u2014 jacket buttoned,\none hand inside a pocket that refused\nto flatten against your body like an empty sleeve.\nThe clock said three and meant it.\n\nHe shifted his hold on whatever he carried.\nLight from above your hat made the nail\nholding it look like a moon with no orbit, just velocity,\nfalling through the ceiling's eye.\n\nThe dog went back to breathing. Her lungs were\nthe only things in the building that knew what they were doing.\n\nI pressed myself flat against the mattress'\nseam \u2014 that small ridge refusing comfort\nlike a wound keeping its own shape. The radiator settled.\nThat was the last sound worth mentioning,\nthough the building let out a slow exhale, and somewhere downstairs\na door closed twice then opened once more.\nOrdinary traffic. Someone walking across the landing with\nthe quiet purpose of someone who has come only to fetch a key.\n\nSleep drew its one thread tighter \u2014 not an answer,\nbut the sound a body makes when it stops\ntrying to explain itself. My fingers curled inside the crease where heat had been.\n\nThat was what happened, underneath it all.",
