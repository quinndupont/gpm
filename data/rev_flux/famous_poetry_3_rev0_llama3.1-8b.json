  "final_poem": "The trees stand tall in winter's sleep\nTheir branches etched against the deep blue sky\nSnowflakes gently falling all around\nA soothing silence that whispers peace to found\n\nI stop beneath their frozen boughs to stay\nTo breathe the crisp air and watch the snow drift away\nMy heart is filled with love and gentle care\nFor those I hold dear, for promises we share\n\nThe fire crackles in my thoughts of home\n Memories of laughter, tears that have been known\nYet here among these winter trees so still\nI feel a sense of calm and peaceful will\n\nPromises made to loved ones, true as can be\nA bond between us, strong and free from care's decree\nIn this quiet moment I commit once more\nTo keep the vows we've spoken, forevermore.",
