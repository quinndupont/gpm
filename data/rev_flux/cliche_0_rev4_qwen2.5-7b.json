      "draft": "In winter's frost, beneath moonlit skies,\nShe walks alone, her thoughts as clear and cold.\nYet, every day, he watches from on high,\nA silent star, his heart a steadfast hold.\n\nSpring blooms bloom, a soft and gentle hue,\nHer laughter, sweet as petals freshly born.\nEach petal falls; each one, a memory true\nOf springtimes past when first their hearts were sworn.\n\nSummer's heat, it blazes like the sun,\nYet she remains unscathed by its glow.\nHe watches still, his presence never gone,\nA cool breeze whispering through leaves below.\n\nAutumn comes with tales of fruit and fall,\nAnd though her heart has learned to stand alone,\nShe finds within each season, some part\nOf him who kept watch as seasons turned and grown.",
      "critique": "What works:\n- The imagery of seasons and natural cycles effectively symbolizes the enduring nature of true love.\n- The character's independence and integrity are well portrayed through her actions and thoughts.\n- The structure with iambic pentameter provides a balanced flow, enhancing the lyrical quality.\n\nIssues (type, location, direction):\n1. Rhyme Scheme:\n   - Deviation: Line 3 (\"high\") does not rhyme with \"skies\" (expected A pair).\n     Direction: Consider revising line 3 to \"from on high,\" which rhymes with \"skies.\"\n2. Rhyme Scheme:\n   - Deviation: Line 14 (\"alone\") does not rhyme with \"fall\" (expected G pair).\n     Direction: Revise the final couplet to ensure proper rhyme, perhaps by changing \"alone\" to another word that rhymes with \"fall.\"\n\n3. Meter:\n   - Variations: The poem contains some trochees and pyrrhics which deviate from iambic pentameter.\n     Direction: Consider adjusting lines 1, 3, and 9 to maintain more consistent iambic rhythm.\n\nSpecific Directions:\n- Line 3: Change \"from on high\" to \"from above,\" maintaining the rhyme while keeping the imagery strong.\n- Line 14: Replace \"alone\" with a word that rhymes with \"fall.\" For example, you could change it to \"stayed.\"\n- Lines 1, 3, and 9: Adjust these lines to ensure they follow iambic pentameter more closely. For instance:\n  - Line 1: \"In winter's frost, beneath moonlit skies,\"\n  - Line 3: \"Yet, every day, he watches from above,\"\n  - Line 9: \"Summer's heat, it blazes like the sun,\"\n\nWhen these adjustments are made, this poem has found its shape.",
