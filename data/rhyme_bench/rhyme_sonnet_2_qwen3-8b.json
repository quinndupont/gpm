Thy robes of shadowed dread,  \nOnce feared as king, now fades to silent night.  \nThee, monsters dread, yet in thy hollow head  \nNo pride can dwell\u2014no triumph, no delight.  \nThy power, a sleep that Time and Fate defy,  \nA slumber where the soul transcends the form.  \nThough kings and empires crumble, thou art nigh  \nA ghost that fades, a dream that melts to storm.  \nYet in thy grasp, the brave and pure shall find  \nA passage to the stars, not end nor grave.  \nSo let thy hollow crown be laid aside\u2014  \nThy reign is but a whisper, brief, and brave.  \nFor in the dark, where all things end, we rise,  \nAnd Death, once proud, becomes the very skies.",
