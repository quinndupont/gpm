  "final_poem": "Upon my heart, thy love doth brightly shine;  \nLike golden sun that summons dawn to day\u2014    \nThy warmth in every whisper of sweet time,   \nDoth like a summer' endlessly splay and play:       In thee I find delight as clear  \nAs the azure sky from which gentle breezes blow. My love for you is constant; just so does each breath bring forth fresh zephyrs to dance upon thine eyes with ephemeral touch of joy\u2014a summer's day in every beat, a sunrise within thy gaze and dusk retreat:    \nIn thee I find delight as clear  \nAs the azure sky from which gentle breezes blow. My love for you is constant; just so does each breath bring forth fresh zephyrs to dance upon thine eyes with ephemeral touch of joy\u2014a summer's day in every beat, a sunrise within thy gaze and dusk retreat:    \nThy heart beats as the tide 'neath lunar sway; its rhythm like waves on shore    In thee I find delight. As constant stars that watch o\u2019er nightly scene   Thou art mine eternal summer, fair\u2014 my love for you is evergreen and free of frost:    \nThy heart beats as the tide 'neath lunar sway; its rhythm like waves on shore    In thee I find delight. As constant stars that watch o\u2019er nightly scene   Thou art mine eternal summer, fair\u2014 my love for you is evergreen and free of frost:    \nAnd thus we waltz in time's sweet passage through the years; thy laughter rings as bells at morn when sun doth climb. My heart with joy it does ascend    In thee I find delight, a summer day reborn\u2014 my love for you endures beyond measure and all climes:    \nAnd thus we waltz in time's sweet passage through the years; thy laughter rings as bells at morn when sun doth climb. My heart with joy it does ascend    In thee I find delight, a summer day reborn\u2014 my love for you endures beyond measure and all climes:    \nThine eyes hold sparks of fire to warm the soul; thy smile is ray that pierces ice   When winter\u2019s chill in cruel fashion comes. Yet even then thou shalt not fade    In thee I find delight, no fearful snow doth dare defile\u2014 my love for you remains as evergreen and bright:    \nThine eyes hold sparks of fire to warm the soul; thy smile is ray that pierces ice   When winter\u2019s chill in cruel fashion comes. Yet even then thou shalt not fade    In thee I find delight, no fearful snow doth dare defile\u2014 my love for you remains as evergreen and bright:    \nIn every season' s turn our hearts entwine; such grace 'tis rare to behold   As summer sun that kisses earth with warmth divine. My heart in thy embrace finds peace at last    In thee I find delight, a blissful summers\u2019 day untaught\u2014 my love for you as constant and vast:    \nIn every season's turn our hearts entwine; such grace 'tis rare to behold   As summer sun that kisses earth with warmth divine. My heart in thy embrace finds peace at last    In thee I find delight, a blissful summers\u2019 day untaught\u2014 my love for you as constant and vast:    \nLet none deceive or turn from me; like the steadfast ever-glowing rose   Thy beauty shines eternal in mine affection's throne. My heart with thee forever shall comply    In all of time, no cruel frost can claim thy glee\u2014 my love for you endures as constant and pure:    \nLet none deceive or turn from me; like the steadfast ever-glowing rose   Thy beauty shines eternal in mine affection's throne. My heart with thee forever shall comply    In all of time, no cruel frost can claim thy glee\u2014 my love for you endures as constant and pure:    \nTo walk within your presence is to know the art Of living life without a single strand astray; Thy essence wraps 'round me like verdant vines that cling   To ancient oaks, strong yet swayed by summer's play. My heart with thee forever shall comply    In all of time and through every turn or twist\u2014 my love for you as constant is the sunset sky:    \nTo walk within your presence is to know the art Of living life without a single strand astray; Thy essence wraps 'round me like verdant vines that cling   To ancient oaks, strong yet swayed by summer's play. My heart with thee forever shall comply    In all of time and through every turn or twist\u2014 my love for you as constant is the sunset sky:    0\n",
