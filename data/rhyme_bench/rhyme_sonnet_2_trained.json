As though the grave could hold its case.\nI'll not exalt thee, Death, although thou'rt seen\nOutstrip all other ills that men sustain:\nThou art no lord o'er me. O, let thy train\nDraw shorter, shrivel in thy death-bed's woof,\nBefore thy pomp have made thy kingdom real!\nFor what the living fear, the dead shall not:\nNo hourly visit, no eternal sleep,\nShall wake thee, nor shalt thou taste rest, except\nThe world's sweet wakings have been mistook for thine.\nI am no psalmist. Yet I must refuse\nThe lie that gives thy title wings to fly.",
