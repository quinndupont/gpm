  "final_poem": "When sunshine doth illume thy lovely face,\nAs morning dew upon green grass doth lie,\nMy heart, aflame with love's sweet, secret place,\nDoth find its haven in thine gentle eye.\n\nThe warmth of summer's breeze that whispers low\nOf tender joys and languid afternoons,\nThat gentle heat which makes the heart bestow\nIts deepest passions on thy lovely tune,\n\nBut when the sun dips low into the west,\nAnd day's last light doth fade from sight to night,\nThy love, like morning sunshine at its best,\nDoth still shine bright, and with it takes flight.\n\nYet, as the summer wanes into autumn's chill,\nMy heart remains forever warm with thee.",
