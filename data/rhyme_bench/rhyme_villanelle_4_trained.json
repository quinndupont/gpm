The bed is not the same.\nWhat started as a spring has become sand.\n\nI watched the field go under, fence by strand,\nand grass move in where nothing grew before.\nThe river does not know it leaves the land\u2014\n\nbut banks erode. What bordered seems to stand\nas something else entirely, nameless, worn.\nWhat started as a spring has become sand,\n\nnow carrying silt I cannot trace or understand.\nI watched the field go under, fence by strand,\nand grass move in where nothing grew before.\n\nThe river does not know it leaves the land\u2014\nit only moves. The bed rewritten, charmed\nby time's own script: what was is now no more.\n\nWhat started as a spring has become sand,\n\nnow carrying silt I cannot trace or understand.\nI watched the field go under, fence by strand,\nand grass move in where nothing grew before.",
