  "final_poem": "When summer's warmth doth kiss thy fair cheek,\nLike blossoms kissed by morning's gentle sun,\nThy love does warmer far than any beach,\nWhere waves of joy upon the sands are run.\nFor thou art brighter, in my heart, than light\nThat flickers o'er a field at twilight\u2019s close,\nAnd sweeter scent than summer breezes lift,\nThat from rich meadows on the zephyrs rose.\n\nYet, when some dastard tempest doth arise\nTo darken skies with gloomy clouded might,\nThy love's soft rays pierce through the cloudy guise,\nAs sunlight breaks in fleeting beams of light.\nThus, dear one, let no storming winds take flight;\nFor thou art summer\u2019s joy in winter\u2019s sight.",
