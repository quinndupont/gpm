Homeward bound into unknown dreamy lands \u2013 adventures yet unfolded for all who dare explore them beyond mere sight or touch (A)  \nThe road beneath, a path worn by countless tales unspoken lies within its every groan; each stone has seen the world turn around and back again - stories they could share if asked! We are these stones now intertwined with theirs as we travel through time together. Homeward bound into unknown dreamy lands \u2013 adventures yet unfolded for all who dare explore them beyond mere sight or touch (B)",
